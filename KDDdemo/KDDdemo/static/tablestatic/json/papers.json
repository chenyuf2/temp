Most of the current research efforts in DTNs focus on data forwarding, but only limited work has examined the problem of providing effective access of fused information to mobile users. In this paper, we examine a QoI metric - provenance (``to come from') - which enables a user to establish trust in an information product that is obtained by fusing raw data from one or more information sources (with varying degrees of trust). In particular, we examine a semi-ring model for provenance that allows us to quantify and compare ``provenance levels' and propose a novel approach to support provenance queries in DTNs using a cooperative in-network caching approach. To address the challenges of opportunistic network connectivity in DTNs, our basic idea is to intentionally cache both data and its provenance at a set of Network Central Locations (NCLs), which can be easily accessed by other nodes in the network. We propose an effective scheme which ensures appropriate NCL selection based on a probabilistic selection metric, and furthermore coordinate multiple caching nodes to optimize the tradeoff between quality (provenance level), data accessibility and caching overhead. By extensive trace-driven simulations, we show that our proposed caching scheme significantly improves the performance of data access, in terms of the provenance level and data access delay, compared to existing schemes."

        "abstract": "Publish-subscribe (pub-sub) is an emerging paradigm for building a large number of distributed systems. A wide area pub-sub system is usually implemented on an overlay network infrastructure to enable information dissemination from publishers to subscribers. Using an open overlay network raises several security concerns such as: confidentiality and integrity, authentication, authorization and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In this paper we present EventGuard - a framework for building secure wide area pub-sub systems. The EventGuard architecture is comprised of three key components: (1) a suite of security guards that can be seamlessly plugged-into a content-based pub-sub system, (2) a scalable key management algorithm to enforce access control on subscribers, and (3) a resilient pub-sub network design that is capable of scalable routing, handling message dropping-based DoS attacks and node failures. The design of EventGuard mechanisms aims at providing security guarantees while maintaining the systems overall simplicity, scalability and performance metrics. We describe an implementation of the EventGuard pub-sub system to show that EventGuard is easily stackable on any content-based pub-sub core. We present detailed experimental results that quantify the overhead of the EventGuard pub-sub system and demonstrate its resilience against various attacks."

        "abstract": "The goal of a tactical military network is to provide information superiority over an opposing force.  This information superiority increases mission tempo if the information can be used to make correct decisions within time constraints.  To achieve this goal, a sufficient amount of information must be received with a required quality. The information quality implicitly accounts for the level of security provided. In this paper we examine the dependencies between security and other factors that affect the information quality. We incorporate the notion of the amount of information of sufficient quality received over time as the operational information content capacity. We discuss the complex tradeoffs that arise while providing security properties: the decision maker may require certain security properties to use information, but the provision of such properties may degrade the ability of the network to deliver the required amount of information in time, thus lowering the operational information content capacity of the network.

WSNs are constrained by both limited bandwidth and energy. In-network processing is an attractive option for conserving bandwidth by reducing data volume at a cost of processing energy and perhaps lower quality of information received.  Recently, we developed a utility-based distributed protocol which determines the optimal compression ratio at each forwarding node considering the trade-offs of loss of utility from excessive compression and expenditure of energy for communication and computation.  Here we present an implementation and evaluation of the NUM-INP protocol on an 802.11b network with a video streaming application. We show that the implementation results are in agreement with those obtained from discrete-event simulations. This work is highly applicable to military WSNs which must support multiple simultaneous missions of differing priorities."

Specifically,\ntrust here is definitionally independent of, albeit constrained\nby, other relevant modalities such as commitments and beliefs.\nTrust applies to a variety of attributes of the relationship\nbetween truster and trustee.  For example, an agent may trust\nsomeone to possess an important capability, exercise good\njudgment, or to intend to help it.  Although such varieties of\ntrust are hugely different, they respect common logical patterns.\nWe present a logic of trust that expresses such patterns as\nreasoning postulates concerning the static representation of\ntrust, its dynamics, and its relationships with teamwork and\nother agent interactions.  In this manner, the proposed logic\nillustrates the general properties of trust that reflect natural\nintuitions, and can facilitate the engineering of multiagent\nsystems."

        "abstract": "With the maturity and wide availability of GPS, wireless, telecommunication, and Web technologies, massive amounts of object movement data have been collected from various moving object targets, such as animals, mobile devices, vehicles, and climate radars. Analyzing such data has deep implications in many applications, e.g., ecological study, traffic control, mobile communication management, and climatological forecast. In this paper, we focus our study on animal movement data analysis and examine advanced data mining methods for discovery of various animal movement patterns. In particular, we introduce a moving object data mining system, MoveMine, which integrates multiple data mining functions, including sophisticated pattern mining and trajectory analysis. In this system, two interesting moving object pattern mining functions are newly developed: (1) periodic behavior mining and (2) swarm pattern mining. For mining periodic behaviors, a reference location-based method is developed, which first detects the reference locations, discovers the periods in complex movements, and then finds periodic patterns by hierarchical clustering. For mining swarm patterns, an efficient method is developed to uncover flexible moving object clusters by relaxing the popularly-enforced collective movement constraints.  In the MoveMine system, a set of commonly used moving object mining functions are built and a user-friendly interface is provided to facilitate interactive exploration of moving object data mining and flexible tuning of the mining constraints and parameters. MoveMine has been tested on multiple kinds of real data sets, especially for MoveBank applications and other moving object data analysis. The system will benefit scientists and other users to carry out versatile analysis tasks to analyze object movement regularities and anomalies. Moreover, it will benefit researchers to realize the importance and limitations of current techniques and promote future studies on moving object data mining. As expected, a mastery of movement patterns and trends will\nimprove our understanding of the interactions between moving object and will have military applications for studying tactical mobility."

Our results also imply the potential for optimization and trade-offs in synchronization problems with time delays."

        "abstract": "Routing in delay tolerant networks (DTN) have attracted a great interest recently. Since mobile social networks or pocket switched networks are widely available examples of DTNs, it is significant to perform an accurate analysis of the social network properties of these networks for the design of efficient routing protocols. In this paper, we first propose a new metric for detecting the quality of friendships more accurately. Using the proposed metric, each node defines its friendship community as the nodes having close friendship with itself either directly or indirectly. Then, we present Temporal Friendship Routing in which temporal differentiation of friendships is utilized in the forwarding decisions of messages. Real trace-driven simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides better delivery rate with smaller number of forwards than the existing algorithm."

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method of generating mobility traces based on Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs). A PCFG is a generalization of a context free grammar in which each production rule is augmented with a probability with which this production is applied during sentence generation. A concise PCFG can be inferred from the given real world trace collected from the actual mobile node behaviors. The resulting grammar can be used to generate sequences of arbitrary length mimicking the mobile node behavior. This is important when new protocol designs for mobile networks are tested by simulation. In the paper, we describe the methods developed to construct such grammars from training data (mobility history). We also discuss how to generate the synthetic data with an already constructed grammar. We present the experimental results on two real data sets, measuring similarity of the actual traces with the synthetic ones. We compare our grammar based method to a 2-level Markov Model based trace generation method. The\nresults demonstrate that the grammar based approach works as an excellent compression method for the actual data. On many\nmetrics, the synthetic data generated from the PCFG match the training data much better than the one generated by the Markov\nModel."

The goal is to maximize the Value of Information (VoI) for WSN users. We discuss three different levels of WSN architecture. The lowest level focuses on individual nodes and their basic functions of sensing and routing. We give an example showing how the use of auctions at individual nodes can help to efficiently perform these functions. The middle level focuses on services that are abstractions of applications running on sensors. Complex applications are composed automatically from basic\nones. We discuss the use of switch options to address some of the challenges arising in such dynamic service composition. Finally, we consider the highest level  network deployment and sharing  and conjecture that options may be valuable in creating proper incentives for rational deployment and sharing of WSNs."

Here, we investigate optimization in fundamental synchronization and flow problems where\nthe weights are proportional to (k_ik_j)^b with k_i and k_j being the degrees of the nodes connected by the edge. In the context of synchronization, these weights represent the allocation of limited resources (coupling strength), while in the associated random\nwalk and current flow problems, they control the extent of hub avoidance, relevant in routing and search. In this Chapter, we review fundamental connections between stochastic synchronization, random walks, and current flow, and we discuss optimization\nproblems for these processes in the above weighted networks."

        "abstract": "In a delay tolerant network (DTN), nodes are connected intermittently and the future node connections are mostly unknown. Since in these networks, a fully connected path from source to destination is unlikely to exist, message delivery relies on opportunistic routing. However, effective forwarding based on a limited knowledge of contact behavior of nodes is challenging. Most of the previous studies looked at only the pairwise node relations to decide routing. In contrast, in this paper, we analyze the correlation between the meetings of each node with other nodes and focus on the utilization of this correlation for efficient routing of messages. We introduce a new metric called conditional intermeeting time, which computes the average intermeeting time between two nodes relative to a meeting with a third node using only the local knowledge of the past contacts. Then, we show how we can utilize the proposed metric on the existing DTN routing protocols to improve their performance. For shortest-path based routing protocols in DTNs, we propose to route messages over conditional shortest paths in which the link cost between nodes are defined by conditional intermeeting times. Moreover, for metric-based forwarding protocols, we propose to use conditional intermeeting time as an additional delivery metric while making forwarding decisions of messages. Our trace-driven simulations on three different datasets show that the modified algorithms perform better than the original ones."

However, human traces are barely random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modelling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile-phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws, but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents."

Despite recent studies in online domains, little is known about factors that could affect the dissemination of a single piece of information. In this paper, we address this challenge by combining two related but distinct datasets, collected from a large scale privacy-preserving distributed social sensor system. We find that the social and organizational context significantly impacts to whom and how fast people forward information. Yet the structures within spreading processes can be well captured by a simple stochastic branching model, indicating surprising independence of context. Our results build the foundation of future predictive models of information flow and provide significant insights towards design of communication platforms."

        "abstract": "Despite recent advances in uncovering the quantitative features of stationary human activity patterns, many applications, from pandemic prediction to emergency response, require an understanding of how these patterns change when the population encounters unfamiliar conditions. To explore societal response to external perturbations we identified real-time changes in communication and mobility patterns in the vicinity of eight emergencies, such as bomb attacks and earthquakes, comparing these with eight non-emergencies, like concerts and sporting events. We find that communication spikes accompanying emergencies are both spatially and temporally localized, but information about emergencies spreads globally, resulting in communication avalanches that engage in a significant manner the social network of eyewitnesses. These results offer a quantitative view of behavioral changes in human activity under extreme conditions, with potential long-term impact on emergency detection and response."

        "abstract": "With the advent of smartphone technology, it has become possible to conceive of entirely new classes of applications. Social swarming, in which users armed with smartphones are directed by a central director to report on events in the physical world, has several real-world applications: search and rescue, coordinated fire-fighting, and the DARPA balloon hunt challenge. In this paper, we focus on the following problem: how does the director optimize the selection of reporters to deliver credible corroborating information about an event. We first propose a model, based on common intuitions of believability, about the credibility of information. We then cast the problem posed above as a discrete optimization problem, prove hardness results, introduce optimal centralized solutions, and design an approximate solution amenable to decentralized implementation whose performance is about 20% off on average from the optimal (on real-world datasets derived from Google News) while being 3 orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. More interesting, a time-averaged version of the problem is amenable to a novel stochastic utility optimization formulation, and can be solved optimally, while in some cases yielding decentralized solutions. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose and explore the problem of extracting credible information from a network of smartphones."

In this paper we argue that existing general purpose approaches usually only focus on one of two issues related to the dif?culties faced by adaptation: 1) difference in base feature statistics or 2) task differences that can be detected with labeled data.\n\nWe argue that it is necessary to combine these two classes of adaptation algorithms, using evidence collected through theoretical analysis and simulated and real-world data experiments. We find that the combined approach often outperforms the individual adaptation approaches. By combining simple approaches from each class of adaptation algorithm, we achieve state-of-the-art results for both Named Entity Recognition adaptation task and the Preposition Sense Disambiguation adaptation task. Second, we also show that applying an adaptation algorithm that finds shared representation between domains often impacts the choice in adaptation algorithm that makes use of target labeled data.\n"

We observe that structured output problems often have a companion learning problem of determining whether agiven input possesses a good structure. For example, the companion problem for the part-of-speech (POS) tagging task asks whether a given sequence of words has a corresponding sequenceof POS tags that is legitimate. While obtaining direct supervision for structures is difficult and expensive, it is often very easy to obtain indirect supervision from the companion binary decision problem.In this paper, we develop a large margin framework that jointly learns from both direct and indirect forms of supervision. Our experiments exhibit the significant contribution of the easy-toget indirect binary supervision on three important NLP structure learning problems.\n"

Many natural language processing (NLP) decision problems are defined over an expressive intermediate representation that is not explicit in the input, leaving the algorithm with both the task of recovering a good intermediate representation and learning to classify correctly. Most current systems separate the learning problem into two stages by solving the first step of recovering the intermediate representation heuristically and using it to learn the final classifier. This paper develops a novel joint learning algorithm for both tasks, that uses the final prediction to guide the selection of the best intermediate representation. We evaluate our algorithm on three different NLP tasks -- transliteration, paraphrase identification and textual entailment -- and show that our joint method significantly improves performance.\n"

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of discovering influential groups of agents using composite network analysis in the absence of individual performance data. We use baseball and the dynamics of players and game outcomes as a specific system of study. Individual players are grouped in teams for each game and there is mobility of players between teams throughout and across seasons. While a game outcome is a direct measure of the performance of the whole team, it is hard to directly evaluate the performance of arbitrary subgroups of teammates since their effectiveness or lack thereof is dependent on a variety of factors both internal to that subgroup, as well as external to that subgroup (e.g. - the opposing team, etc.). Secondly, we assume that while individual participation (playing time) may be measured, individual performance cannot be directly measured. Within these constraints, our goal is to decouple the subgroup performance from that of the whole team and discover significantly effective or ineffective subgroups.\n\nWe propose a model of individual and group effectiveness, based on historical performance data. The statistical significance of a subgroup's performance is computed as the p-value of its success with respect to a background historical distribution of subgroups of similar player profiles. Though this measure is capable of discovering the most significant conformations of players, it is inefficient to evaluate as it requires enumeration and significance tests for all possible subgroups of players (levying an unscalable combinatorial cost).\n\nWe develop a tractable approximation of the group significance measure, based on a composite network model. There are two kinds of nodes in our network model: players and teams. Game outcomes are treated as independent and three types of edges are added between aforementioned nodes: (i) a directed edge from a losing team to a winning team (ii) directed edges from players on the losing team to their team and from the winning team to its players, and (iii) undirected edges between players on the same team. Edges are weighted based on the statistical significance of game outcomes given the team lineups and historical data. We overlay this structural information for the outcomes of all games in a season. We compute a random walk measure in the resulting composite weighted network that approximates our original measure, but is computationally tractable. "

        "abstract": "In this paper,  we study the problem of transfer learning from text to images in the context of network data in which link based bridges are available to transfer the knowledge between the different domains. The problem of classification of image data is often much more challenging than text data because of the following two reasons: (a) Labeled text data is very widely available for classification purposes. On the other hand, this is often not the case for image data, in which a lot of images are available from many sources, but many of them are often not labeled. (b)  The image features are not directly related to semantic concepts inherent in class labels. On the other hand, since text data tends to have\nnatural semantic interpretability (because of their human origins), they are often more directly related to class labels.\n\nThe semantic challenges of image features are glaringly evident, when we attempt to recognize complex abstract concepts, and the visual features often fail to discriminate such concepts. However, the copious availability of bridging relationships between text and images in the context of web and social network data can be used in order to design for effective classifiers for image data. The relationships between the images and text features (which may be\nderived from such web-centered bridges)  provide additional hints for the classification process in terms of the image feature transformations which provide the most effective results. One of our goals in this paper is to develop a mathematical model for the functional relationships between text and image features, so as to {em indirectly transfer semantic knowledge through feature transformations}.  This feature transformation is accomplished by mapping instances from different domains into a common space of unspecified topics. This is used as a bridge to semantically connect the two heterogeneous spaces.  We evaluate our knowledge transfer techniques  on an image classification task with labeled text corpora and show the effectiveness with respect to competing algorithms."

        "abstract": "In recent years, knowledge transfer algorithms have become one of the most active research areas in learning visual concepts. Most of the existing learning algorithms focuses on leveraging the knowledge transfer process which is specific to a given category.  However, in many cases, such a process may not be very effective when a particular target category has very few samples.  In such cases, it is interesting to examine, whether it is feasible to use  {_x0008_f cross-category knowledge}  for improving the learning process by exploring the knowledge in correlated categories. Such a task can be quite challenging  due to variations in  semantic similarities and differences between categories, which could either help or hinder the cross-category learning process. In order to address this challenge, we develop a cross-category label propagation algorithm, which can directly propagate the inter-category knowledge {_x0008_f at instance level} between the source and the target categories.  Furthermore, this algorithm can automatically detect conditions under which the transfer process can be detrimental to the learning process.  This provides us a way to know when the transfer of cross-category knowledge is both useful and desirable. We present experimental results on   real image and video data sets in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

        "abstract": "The problem of transfer learning has recently been of great interest in a variety of content-based mining applications.\nThe main goal of transfer learning has been in the context of the classification problem in which some domains such as\nimage data have very few labeled examples, whereas other domains such as text have a copious number of labeled examples. In many cases such as image and text, correspondence data is available which is used as a bridge in order to learn the relationships of the features in the two domains which is subsequently used for problems such as classification. In this paper, we will examine a new angle to the transfer learning problem, where we examine the varying semantic gap between different domains, rather than the sparse label problem, which is the key motivation for most transfer learning\napplications. A good semantic understanding of the feature space is critical in providing the domain specific understanding for setting up good distance functions. Unfortunately, not all domains have feature representations which\nare equally interpretable. For example, in some domains such as text, the semantics of the feature representation are\nclear, as a result of which it is easy for a domain expert to set up distance functions for specific kinds of semantics by\nselecting certain words in the feature selection process. In the case of image data, the features are semantically harder\nto interpret, and it is harder to set up distance functions, especially for particular semantic criteria. In this paper, we\nfocus on the problem of transfer learning as a way to close the semantic gap between different domains, and show how\nto use correspondence information between two domains in order to set up distance functions for the semantically more\nchallenging domain. As a specific example, we will provide a case study of the text to image correspondence, and show\nhow to set up distance functions for the image domain in an automated way with specific criteria."

        "abstract": "Social and communication networks across the world generate vast amounts of graph data each day. The modeling and prediction of how these graph structures evolve can be highly useful for many applications. Previous research in this area has focused largely on using past graph structure to predict future links. However, a useful observation is that many graph datasets have additional information associated with them beyond just their graph structure. In particular, communication graphs (such as email, twitter, blog graphs, etc.) have information content associated with their graph edges. In this paper we examine the link between information content and graph structure, proposing a new graph modeling approach, GC-Model, which combines both. We then apply this model to multiple real world communication graphs, demonstrating that the built models can be used effectively to predict future graph structure and information flow. On average, the top predictions from GC-Model covered 19 percent more of the actual future graph communication structure when compared to other previously introduced algorithms, far outperforming multiple link prediction methods and several naive approaches."

        "abstract": "In Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), end-to-end connectivity between nodes does not always occur due to limited\nradio coverage, node mobility and other factors. Remote communication may assist in guaranteeing delivery. However, it has a considerable cost, and consequently, minimizing it is an important task. For multicast routing, the problem is NP-hard, and naive approaches are infeasible on large problem instances.\nIn this paper we define the problem of minimizing the remote communication cost for multicast in DTNs. Our formulation handles the realistic scenario in which a data source is continuously updated and nodes need to receive recent versions of data. We analyze the problem in the case of scheduled trajectories and known traffic demands, and propose a solution based on a novel graph indexing system. We also present an adaptive extension that can work with limited knowledge of node mobility. Our method reduces the search space significantly and finds an optimal solution in reasonable time. Extensive experimental analysis on large real and synthetic datasets shows that the proposed method completes in less than 10 seconds on datasets with millions of encounters, with an improvement of up to 100 times compared to a naive approach."

We derive an exact formula valid for arbitrary graphs and arbitrary walks with stationary transition probabilities (STP), for the average number of discovered edges as a function of time. We show that for STP walks site and edge exploration obey the same scaling ~n as a function of time n. Therefore, edge exploration on graphs with many loops is always lagging compared to site exploration, the revealed graph being sparse until almost all nodes have been discovered. We then introduce the edge explorer model (EEM), which presents a novel class of adaptive walks, that perform faithful network discovery even on dense networks."

When studying how to revoke trust, we will consider the fuzziness of trust and take two approaches. First, based on its trust level, a nodes privileges are modulated under a model of partial revocation. Second, for better revocation immediacy and abuse resistance, we will explore the idea of mutual trust revocation. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of partial trust revocation in the context of mobile adhoc networks. We first propose the trust management policy for partial revocation, then develop the analytical model, and finally evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation in improving network throughput through simulations. \n\n"

Trust is used as a measure of\nthe likelihood that individuals will believe the message being conveyed to them. The strength of\nties literature [2] suggests that weak ties promote information diffusion by connecting otherwise\ndisconnected groups in a network. Weak ties provide individuals with the access to information\nthat is non-redundant and outside of their social group. The strength of ties depends on the nature\nof the information being diffused [1] and the trust between individuals with respect to acquiring\nknowledge and information [4]. The ability of a node and its ties to bridge information is dependent\non its attributes, position in the network, and likeliness to persist over time [5]. We investigate how\nweak ties and strong ties affect the spread of information.\nWe consider the event where information is broadcasted to a subset of a social network and\nmessages containing the information are spread through interactions between individuals in the\nnetwork. The nature of the information requires the individuals to evaluate the information and\nexhibit different behaviors, such as information seeking, information spreading, or possibly departing\nthe network, depending on their perception of the information.\n2 Model"

        "abstract": "Recently, the mobile devices, such as smartphones, serve as the key computing and communication devices for peoples daily life [1]. A unique characteristic in these applications is that the population of sensing devices is much more crowded than mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSN), which gives rise to a novel area of research, termed Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS). \nIn MCS applications, how to efficiently detect the crowdedness level is an initial yet key step for any further extensions. The crowdedness detection in MCS is similar to the neighbor discovery [2] [3] in MWSN, but it only requires an accurate estimation on the neighbors rather than the specific number of the neighbors. However, this relaxation does not make the crowdedness detection in MCS easier than the neighbor discovery in MWSN, because MCS poses three new constraints. (1) The population of mobile devices is highly dynamic. (2) In MCS the mobile devices work autonomously, i.e., a device cannot assume that these duty cycles are chosen from a specific set. (3) The crowdedness detection is often initiated by the users, so a prompt response to the users is more desired in MCS than in MWSN. These new challenges make existing neighbor discovery schemes [2] [3] unsuitable for the crowdedness detection in MCS. \nBased on above observations, in this poster we propose a new crowdedness detection scheme call Crowd, which serves as a building block for various MCS applications. Under Crowd, the detecting device adapts its duty cycle according the number of neighbors currently found as so to find the dynamic development of the number of beacons, which is sent by the neighbors for the estimation of crowdedness. This poster hopes to contribute as follows: (1) This poster makes an early attempt to detect crowdedness level of a devices neighborhood in mobile crowdsensing applications. (2) This paper proposes a crowdedness detection scheme, called Crowd, with practical constraints of mobile crowdsensing in mind. (3) This paper presents a mobile crowdsensing application, called where is the crowd (WIC), which leverages Crowd to make a suggestion for the users to avoid the crowd. "

When multiple actors contributing\n  to an artifact constitutes a social tie, associations between the\n  artifacts can be used to infer prominence among actors. This is\n  because prominent actors will tend to collaborate on prominent\n  artifacts, and prominent artifacts will be associated with other\n  prominent artifacts.  Our testbed example is the DBLP co-authorship\n  graph: multiple authors (the actors) collaborate to publish research\n  papers (the artifacts); collaboration is the social tie. Papers have\n  prominence themselves (eg. quality and impact of the work) and the\n  prominence of the venues are tied to the prominence of the papers\n  in them.  We use our methods to infer prominence based on the venue-based\n  associations of papers, and compare our rankings with external\n  citation based measures of prominence. We compare with numerous\n  other ranking algorithms, and show that the ranking performance gain\n  from using the venues is statistically significant.\n\n  What if there are no natural artifact groups like venues? We\n  develop a new algorithm which uses discovered artifact groups.\n  Our approach consists of two steps. First, we find artifact groups\n  by linking artifacts with common contributors. Note\n  that instead of finding communities of actors, we consider\n  communities of artifacts. We then use these grouped artifacts\n  in the prominence ranking algorithm.  \n  We consider different methods for obtaining the\n  artifact groups, in particular a very efficient embedding based\n  algorithm for graph clustering and show the effectiveness of our\n  method in improving the ranking of actors. The inferred groups are\n  as good as or better than the natural conference venues for DBLP.\n"

Personality has been shown to be relevant to many types of interactions; it has been shown to be useful in predicting job satisfaction, professional and romantic relationship success, and even preference for dif- ferent interfaces. Until now, to accurately gauge users per- sonalities, they needed to take a personality test. This made it impractical to use personality analysis in many social me- dia domains. In this paper, we present a method by which a users personality can be accurately predicted through the publicly available information on their Facebook profile. We will describe the type of data collected, our methods of anal- ysis, and the results of predicting personality traits through machine learning. We then discuss the implications this has for social media design, interface design, and broader do- mains."

        "abstract": "Recent popularization of personal hand-held mobile devices makes\nit important to characterize the mobility pattern of mobile device\nusers, so as to accurately predict user mobility in the future. Currently,\nthe user mobility pattern is mostly characterized at a coarsegrained\nlevel, in the form of transition among wireless Access Points\n(APs). There is limited research effort on the fine-grained characterization\nof geographical user movement. In this paper, we present\na novel approach to characterize the steady-state and transient-state\nuser mobility behaviors at a fine-grained level, based on the Hidden\nMarkov Model (HMM) formulation of user mobility. By applying\nour approach on both realistic mobility traces and synthetic mobility\nscenarios, we show that our approach is effective in characterizing\nuser mobility pattern and making accurate mobility prediction.\nWe also experimentally demonstrate that fine-grained user mobility\nknowledge is more effective to improve the performance of a\nvariety of mobile computing applications."

Different from these works, we study the data dif-\nfusion problem which diffuses data among all moving nodes so that the nodes that\nare interested in this data item can get it easily either from their encountered friend\nnodes or stranger nodes. To reduce the data access delay, we introduce four social-\naware data diffusion schemes based on the social relationship and data similarity\nof the contacts. We also provide solutions to quantify data/interest similarity and to\ndetermine whether two nodes are friends or strangers. Theoretical models are devel-\noped to analyze the data diffusion process and compare the performance of the four\nproposed diffusion schemes in terms of diffusion speed and query delay.We use real\ntraces of human contacts to emulate data diffusion under different schemes. Both\ntheoretical analysis and experimental results imply an interesting fact: to achieve\nbetter diffusion performance, each node should first diffuse the data similar to their\ncommon interests when it meets a friend, and first diffuse the data different to their\ncommon interests when it meets a stranger."

Uncovering such knowledge is essential for role discovery, data cleaning, and better organization of information networks, especially when the semantically meaningful relationships are hidden or mingled with noisy links. In this paper we study a generic form of relationship along which objects can form a tree-like hierarchical structure, since it has wide applications in various domains. We study the problem of mining hierarchical relationships and formalize it in a supervised setting. In general, local features of object attributes, their interaction patterns, as well as rules and constraints for knowledge propagation can be used to infer the structures. Existing approaches, designed for specific applications, either cannot handle dependency rules together with local features, or cannot leverage labeled data to differentiate their importance. In this study, we propose a discriminative undirected graphical model. It integrates a wide range of features and rules by defining potential functions with simple forms. These functions are also summarized and categorized. Our experiments on two quite different domains demonstrate how to apply the method to encode domain knowledge. The efficacy is measured with both traditional and our newly designed metrics in the evaluation of discovered tree structures."

Second, forwarding nodes cannot be as much\ntrusted as fixed routers in the Internet environment, and\ncompromised nodes may collude in DoS attacks. Moreover,\nboth the scale of a MANET and its data traffic rate\nare much smaller than that of the high-speed Internet. In\nthis work, we make the first effort to quantitatively analyze\nthe impacts of node mobility, attack packet rate, and\npath length on the traceability of two types of well-known\nIP traceback schemes: probabilistic packet marking (PPM)\nand hash-based logging. We then design an authenticated\nK-sized Probabilistic Packet Marking (AK-PPM) scheme,\nwhich not only improves the effectiveness of traceback in\nthe MANET environment, but also provides authentication\nfor marks. Finally, we prove that AK-PPM is asymptotically\none-hop precise, and use both analytical models and simulations\nto measure the performance of AK-PPM in MANETs\nof different settings."

One key observation is that the moving objects in a cluster may actually diverge temporarily and congregate at certain timestamps. The goal of this paper is to find find all discriminative swarms, namely closed swarm. While the search space for closed swarms is prohibitively huge, we design a method, ObjectGrowth, to efficiently retrieve the answer. Empirical studies on the real data as well as large synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods. This work contributes to EDIN E2.2."

The graph query becomes challenging when the network examined is large and divers. This paper presents a high performance graph indexing mechanism, SPath, to address the graph query problem on large networks. SPath leverages decomposed shortest paths around vertex neighborhood as basic indexing units, which prove to be both effective in graph search space pruning and highly scalable in index construction and deployment. We evaluate SPath with the state-of-the-art GraphQL on both real and synthetic data sets. Our experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SPath, which proves to be a more practical and eient indexing method in addressing graph queries on large networks.

Then we propose a new task to extract and align information networks from comparable corpora. As a case study we demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing bi-lingual information networks, we present a weakly-supervised and language-independent approach to mine name translation pairs. Based on the fact that some certain types of expressions are written in language-independent forms, we generate seed pairs automatically. Starting from these seeds, we then apply a bootstrapping algorithm based on link comparison to mine more pairs iteratively. Results show that our approach can produce highly reliable name pairs. We also duplicate two state-of-the-art name translation mining methods and use two existing name translation gazetteers to compare with our approach. Comparisons show our approach can effectively augment the results from each of these alternative methods and resources. "

We assume that a set of objects can be described from various perspectives (multiple information sources). The underlying clustering structure of normal objects is usually shared by multiple sources. However, anomalous objects belong to different clusters when considering different aspects. For example, there exist movies that are expected to be liked by kids by genre, but are liked by grown-ups based on user viewing history. To identify such objects, we propose to compute the distance between different eigen decomposition results of the same object with respect to different sources as its anomalous score. We also give interpretations from the perspectives of constrained spectral clustering and random walks over graph. Experimental results on several UCI as well as DBLP and MovieLens datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

We introduce the concept of meta path-based similarity, where a meta path is a path consisting of a sequence of relations defined between different object types (i.e., structural paths at the meta level). Moreover, we define a novel similarity measure called PathSim that is able to find peer objects in the network (e.g., find authors in the similar field and with similar reputation), which turns out to be more meaningful in many scenarios compared with random-walk based similarity measures. Moreover, we also develop an efficient solution that partially materializes short meta paths and then concatenates them online to compute top-k results.  Experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed paradigm. The method can be used to search similar objects efficiently in large networks.

Yet the existing pattern mining methods cannot offer the efficiency desirable for large pattern discovery. We propose SpiderMine, a novel algorithm to efficiently mine top-K largest frequent patterns from a single massive network with any user-specified probability of 1  . Deviating from the existing edge-by-edge (i.e., incremental) pattern-growth framework, SpiderMine achieves its efficiency by unleashing the power of small patterns of a bounded diameter, which we call spiders. With the spider structure, our approach adopts a probabilistic mining framework to find the top-k largest patterns by (i) identifying an affordable set of promising growth paths toward large patterns, (ii) generating large patterns with much lower combinatorial complexity, and finally (iii) greatly reducing the cost of graph isomorphism tests with a new graph pattern representation by a multi-set of spiders. Extensive experimental studies on both synthetic and real data sets show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods."

Based on a Gaussian random field model, we analyze the probability distribution over the unlabeled vertices conditioned on the label information, which is a multivariate normal with the mean being the harmonic solution over the field. Then we select the nodes to label such that the total variance of the distribution on the unlabeled data, as well as the expected prediction error, is minimized. In this way, the classifier we obtain is theoretically more robust. Our proposed algorithm is parameter-free, and theoretically minimizes the expected error of a graph-based classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed active learner over existing label selection criteria.

This paper studies the problem of coauthor relationship prediction in heterogeneous bibliographic networks, by systematically extracting topological features from the network. A supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-author relationships. We present experiments on a real bibliographic network, the DBLP network, which show that heterogeneous topological features can generate more accurate prediction results as compared to homogeneous topological features. In addition, the level of significance of each topological feature can be learned from the model, which is helpful in understanding the mechanism behind the relationship building.

Traditional link prediction methods are designed to find friends solely relying on social network information. With location and trajectory data available, we can generate more accurate and geographically related results, and help web-based social service users find more friends in the real world. Aiming to recommend geographically related friends in social network, a three-step statistical recommendation approach is proposed for GPS-enabled cyber-physical social network. By combining GPS information and social network structures, we build a pattern-based bipartite graph. Links inside this network reflect both people geographical information, and their social relationships. Our approach estimates link relevance and finds promising geo-friends by employing a random walk process on the bipartite graph. Empirical studies from both synthetic datasets and real-life dataset demonstrate the power of merging GPS data and social graph structure, and suggest our method outperforms other methods for friends recommendation in GPSbased cyber-physical social network.

From among the hundreds of features which were developed, syntactic features were best able to reflect the writing style of an author. However, due to the high computational complexity for extracting and computing syntactic features, only simple variations of basic syntactic features such as function words, POS(Part of Speech) tags, and rewrite rules were considered. In this paper, we propose a new feature set of k-embedded-edge subtree patterns that holds more syntactic information than previous feature sets. We also propose a novel approach to directly mining them from a given set of syntactic trees. We show that this approach reduces the computational burden of using complex syntactic structures as the feature set. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that our approach is reliable and more accurate than previous studies. This work mainly contributes to INARC I3.2."

In a data cube, data from a fact table is aggregated on subsets\nof the table dimensions, forming a collection of smaller tables called cuboids. When the fact table includes sensitive data such as salary or diagnosis, publishing even a subset of its cuboids may compromise individuals privacy. In this paper, we address this problem using differential privacy (DP), which provides provable privacy guarantees for individuals by adding noise to query answers. We choose an initial subset of cuboids to compute directly from the fact table, injecting DP noise as usual; and then compute the remaining cuboids from the initial set. Given a fixed privacy guarantee, we show that it is NP-hard to choose the initial set of cuboids so that the maximal noise over all published cuboids is minimized, or so that the number of cuboids with noise below a given threshold (precise cuboids) is maximized. We provide an efficient procedure with running time polynomial in the number of cuboids to select the initial set of cuboids, such that the maximal noise in all published cuboids will be within a factor $(ln |L| + 1)^2$ of the optimal, where $|L|$ is the number of cuboids to be published, or the number of precise cuboids will be within a factor $(1 - 1/e)$ of the optimal. We also show how to enforce consistency in the published cuboids while simultaneously improving their utility (reducing error). In an empirical evaluation on real and synthetic data, we report the amounts of error of different publishing algorithms, and show that our approaches outperform baselines significantly."

This paper investigates how to rank the trajectory patterns mined from the uploaded photos with geotags and timestamps. The main objective is to reveal the collective wisdom recorded in the seemingly isolated photos and the individual travel sequences reflected by the geo-tagged photos. Through leveraging the relationships among users, locations and trajectories, we rank the trajectory patterns. We then use an exemplar-based algorithm to diversify the results in order to discover the representative trajectory patterns. We have evaluated the proposed framework on 12 different cities using a Flickr dataset and demonstrated its effectiveness. This work mainly contributes to EDIN E2.2."

It is highly desirable to sift meaningful information from a large volume of noisy data. In this paper, we propose a method called Tru-Alarm which finds out trustworthy alarms and increases the feasibility of CPS. Tru-Alarm estimates the locations of objects causing alarms, constructs an object-alarm graph and carries out trustworthiness inferences based on linked information in the graph."

Moreover, the simplistic means by which they are typically calculated can yield misleading results, sometimes dramatically so.  We present a new, standardized set of trust metrics that instead compute the trustworthiness of an information source as a triple of truthfulness, completeness, and bias scores, and argue that these must be calculated relative to the user to be meaningful.

        "abstract": "The high mobility of vehicles and the unreliable\\\\r\\\\nwireless communication significantly degrade the performance of\\\\r\\\\ndata access in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). To address\\\\r\\\\nthis problem, we propose a novel vehicle-platoon aware data\\\\r\\\\naccess solution called V-PADA. In V-PADA, vehicles contribute\\\\r\\\\npart of their buffers to replicate data for others in the same\\\\r\\\\nplatoon and share data with them. When a vehicle leaves the\\\\r\\\\nplatoon, it prefetches interested data and transfers its buffered\\\\r\\\\ndata to other vehicles in advance so that they can still access\\\\r\\\\nthe data after it leaves. To achieve this goal, V-PADA consists of\\\\r\\\\ntwo components. First, a vehicle platooning protocol is designed\\\\r\\\\nto identify platoon formation and predict platoon splits. We use\\\\r\\\\nstochastic time series analysis to detect platoon and mobility\\\\r\\\\nanomaly, and further introduce a two-step split prediction\\\\r\\\\nmethod to reduce the false alarm rate due to road curves. Second,\\\\r\\\\na data management component is designed to guide platoon\\\\r\\\\nmembers to replicate and prefetch the most suitable data so\\\\r\\\\nthat both high data availability and low data access overhead\\\\r\\\\ncan be achieved. Extensive simulation results show that V-PADA\\\\r\\\\ncan effectively improve the data access performance in VANETs."

We argue that such platforms share some of the features of multiagent systems, and ask whether algorithms originally designed for multiagent systems can be leveraged for coordinating the problem solving process among human computers. We study this question in the context of the graph coloring problem where each human controls the color of one vertex, and compare the performance of humans using adaptations of two well-known distributed constraint satisfaction algorithms to the performance of humans that were asked to simply color the graph. We find that people provided with algorithmic instructions achieve significantly better performance than people who are left to their own devices."

Significant work has been done on developing stationary knowledge sources that could potentially support these tasks, but these resources often suffer from low coverage, noise, and are inflexible when needed to support terms that are not identical to those placed in them, making their use as general purpose background knowledge resources difficult. In this paper, rather than building a stationary hierarchical structure of terms and relations, we describe a system that, given two terms, determines the taxonomic relation between them using a machine learning-based approach that makes use of existing resources. Moreover, we develop a global constraint optimization inference process and use it to leverage an existing knowledge base also to enforce relational constraints among terms and thus improve the classifier predictions. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms other systems built upon existing well-known knowledge sources.\n"

Fact-finding algorithms attempt to identify the truth among competing claims in a corpus, but fail to take advantage of the users prior knowledge and presume that truth itself is universal and objective rather than subjective. We introduce a framework for incorporating prior knowledge into any fact-finding algorithm, expressing both general common-sense reasoning and specific facts already known to the user as first-order logic and translating this into a tractable linear program. As our results show, this approach scales well to even large problems, both reducing error and allowing the system to determine truth respective to the user rather than the majority. Additionally, we introduce three new fact-finding algorithms capable of outperforming existing factfinders in many of our experiments.\n"

First, we model the cited author information together with words and paper authors. Such extra contextual information directly models linkage among authors and enhances the author-topic association, thus produces more coherent author-topic distribution. Second, we provide a preliminary solution to the task of expert search when the learning repository contains exclusively research related documents authored by the experts. When compared with a previous proposed model (Johri et al., 2010), the proposed model produces high quality author topic linkage and achieves over 33% error reduction evaluated by the standard MAP measurement.\n"

To accomplish this, the listener must parse the sentence, find constituents that are candidate arguments, and assign semantic roles to those constituents. Each step depends on prior lexical and syntactic knowledge. Where do children learning their first languages begin in solving this problem? In this paper we focus on the parsing and argumentidentification steps that precede Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) training. We combine a simplified SRL with an unsupervised HMM part of speech tagger, and experiment with psycholinguisticallymotivated ways to label clusters resulting from the HMM so that they can be used to parse input for the SRL system. The results show that proposed shallow representations of sentence structure are robust to reductions in parsing accuracy, and that the contribution of alternative representations of sentence structure to successful semantic role labeling varies with the integrity of the parsing and argumentidentification stages.\n"

The key advantage of this method is that it retains the simplicity and the computational efficiency of the unigram model. In addition to a qualitative evaluation, we evaluate the results by using the topic models as a component in a search engine. We exhibit improved retrieval scores when the documents are represented via sets of latent topics and authors.\n\n"

This paper surveys Constraints Conditional Models (CCMs), a framework that augments probabilistic models with declarative constraints as a way to support decisions in an expressive output space while maintaining modularity and tractability of training.We show how CCMs are a very natural choice for modeling an information fusion system which aims to coherently predict multiple output variables with very little information."

This includes scheduling and task processing to maximize utility in stochastic networks with variable length scheduling modes. Every frame, a new policy is implemented that affects the frame size and that creates a vector of attributes. An algorithm is developed for choosing policies on each frame in order to maximize a concave function of the time average attribute vector, subject to additional time average constraints. The algorithm is based on Lyapunov optimization concepts and involves minimizing a drift-plus-penalty ratio over each frame. The algorithm can learn efficient behavior without a-priori statistical knowledge by sampling from the past. Our framework is applicable to a large class of problems, including Markov decision problems."

Specifically, we consider the scenario where a network sequentially receives tasks from an end user, utilizes its resources to process them, and sends back its response. The utility derived by the end user from this response depends on both the accuracy and the freshness of the information. There is often a trade-off between these two attributes and we present a model that quantifies this dependence. Using dynamic programming and optimal stopping theory, we characterize the optimal scheduling policy that maximizes the time average utility delivered by the network. We show that for many scenarios of practical interest, the optimal policy has a simple threshold structure. We also propose a method to approximately compute the threshold in closed-form. This work takes a step towards incorporating application aware objectives in making optimal scheduling decisions."

A key open problem has been the development of utility-optimal algorithms that are also delay efficient. In this paper, we show that the Backpressure algorithm, when combined with the LIFO queueing discipline (called LIFO-Backpressure), is able to achieve a utility that is within O(1/V) of the optimal value for any scalar V  1, while maintaining an average delay of O([log(V)]2) for all but a tiny fraction of the network traffic. This result holds for general stochastic network optimization problems and general Markovian dynamics. Remarkably, the performance of LIFO-Backpressure can be achieved by simply changing the queueing discipline; it requires no other modifications of the original Backpressure algorithm. We validate the results through empirical measurements from a sensor network testbed, which show good match between theory and practice."

        "abstract": "We consider a peer-to-peer network where nodes can send and receive files amongst their peers. File requests are generated randomly, and each new file can correspond to a different subset of peers that already have the file and hence can assist in the download. Nodes that help others are rewarded by being able to download more. The goal is to design a control algorithm that allocates requests and schedules transmissions to maximize overall throughput-utility, subject to meeting tit-for-tat constraints that incentivize participation. Our algorithm is shown to operate efficiently on networks with arbitrary traffic and channel sample paths, including wireless networks whose capacity can be significantly extended by the peer-to-peer functionality."

        "abstract": "With the advent of smartphone technology, it has become possible to conceive of entirely new classes of applica- tions. Social swarming, in which users armed with smartphones are directed by a central director to report on events in the physical world, has several real-world applications. In this paper, we focus on the following problem: how does the director opti- mize the selection of reporters to deliver credible corroborating information about an event? We first propose a model, based on common intuitions of believability, about the credibility of information. We then cast the problem as a discrete optimization problem, and introduce optimal centralized solutions and an approximate solution amenable to decentralized implementation whose performance is about 20% off on average from the optimal while being 3 orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. More interesting, a time-averaged version of the problem is amenable to a novel stochastic utility optimization formulation, and can be solved optimally, while in some cases yielding decentralized solutions."

The traversal time is due to both time spent waiting for edges to appear and time\nspent crossing them once they become available.\nWe compute the expected traversal time (ETT) for a routing path in a number of special\ncases of stochastic edge dynamics models, and for three edge failure models, culminating in a\nsurprisingly challenging yet realistic setting in which the initial con_x000C_figuration of edge states for\nthe entire path is known. We show that the ETT for this *initial con_x000C_figuration* setting can be\ncomputed in quadratic time, by an algorithm based on probability generating functions.

In these networks, nodes are capable of harvesting energy from the environ- ment. The amount of energy that can be harvested is time varying and evolves according to some probability law. We develop an online algorithm, called the Energy-limited Sch- eduling Algorithm (ESA), which jointly manages the energy and makes power allocation decisions for packet transmis- sions. ESA only has to keep track of the amount of energy left at the network nodes and does not require any knowl- edge of the harvestable energy process. We show that ESA achieves a utility that is within O() of the optimal, for any  > 0, while ensuring that the network congestion and the required capacity of the energy storage devices are deter- ministically upper bounded by bounds of size O(1/). We then also develop the Modified-ESA algorithm (MESA) to achieve the same O() close-to-utility performance, with the average network congestion and the required capacity of the energy storage devices being only O([log(1/)]^2)."

        "abstract": "In traditional multihop wireless network broadcast problems, in which a message beginning at one node is relayed to all others, there are two standard transmission methods used: {\\\\em unicast} and {\\\\em broadcast}. If the goal is to transmit a message to all nodes with minimum total cost, these settings lead to a minimum spanning tree (MST) problem or the Connected Dominating Set (CDS) problem, respectively. Neglected, however, is the study of intermediate models in which a node can choose to transmit to an arbitrary subset of its neighbors, incurring a cost based on the number of recipients (who might be required to send acknowledgements for reliability). We focus in this paper on a transmission cost model of the form $1+A k^b$, where $k$ is the number of recipients and $b \\\\ge 0$. This model subsumes MST, CDS, and other problems.\n\nWe give positive and negative results for this problem in a variety of special cases parameterized by $b$. These include showing the problem is approximable with a factor varying smoothly from 2 to 1 as $b$ varies from 1 to $\\\\log_2 (\\\\frac{1}{A}+2)$;  showing that it is essentially equivalent to CDS when $b=0$, and giving a nontrivial approximation algorithm for the setting of $0<b<1$ with factor $(A+2)^2 H_{\\\\Delta+1}$. We also show that the problem is optimally solvable for any $b$ when the communication graph is a clique or a tree.\n"

The objective is to minimize\nthe total cost of the network-wide broadcast, where the cost can\nbe of any form that is summable over all the transmissions (e.g.,\nthe transmission and reception energy, the price for accessing a\nspecific channel). Our technical approach is based on a simplicial\ncomplex model that allows us to capture the broadcast nature\nof the wireless medium and the heterogeneity across radios and\nchannels. Specifically, we show that broadcasting in multi-radio\nmulti-channel ad hoc networks can be formulated as a minimum\nspanning problem in simplicial complexes. We establish the NPcompleteness\nof the minimum spanning problem and propose\ntwo approximation algorithms with order-optimal performance\nguarantee. The first approximation algorithm converts the minimum\nspanning problem in simplical complexes to a minimum\nconnected set cover problem. The second algorithm converts it\nto a node-weighted Steiner tree problem under the classic graph\nmodel. These two algorithms offer tradeoffs between performance\nand time-complexity.

        "abstract": "Credit networks represent a way of modeling trust between entities in a network. Nodes in the network print their own currency and trust each other for a certain amount of each other's currency. This allows the network to serve as a decentralized payment infrastructure---arbitrary payments can be routed through the network by passing IOUs between trusting nodes in their respective currencies---and obviates the need for a common currency. Nodes can repeatedly transact with each other and pay for the transaction using trusted currency. A natural question to ask in this setting is: how long can the network sustain liquidity, i.e.\\\\ how long can the network support the routing of payments before credit dries up? We answer this question in terms of the long term failure probability of transactions for various network topologies and credit values. \nWe prove that the transaction failure probability is independent of the path along which transactions are routed. We show that under symmetric transaction rates, the transaction failure probability in a number of well-known graph families goes to zero as the size, the density or the credit capacity of the network increases. We also show via simulations that even networks of small size and credit capacity can route transactions with high probability if they are well-connected. Further, we characterize a centralized currency system as a special type of a star network (one where edges to the root have infinite credit capacity, and transactions occur only between leaf nodes) and compute the steady-state transaction failure probability in a centralized system. We show that liquidity in star networks, complete graphs and Erd\\\\*{o}s-R\\\\'{e}nyi networks is comparable to that in equivalent centralized currency systems; thus we do not lose much liquidity in return for their robustness and decentralized properties."

        "abstract": "Prior research has provided some evidences of social corre-\nlation (i.e., \\\\you are who you know*), which makes it pos-\nsible to infer one's interests from social neighbors. How-\never, it is also shown to be challenging to consistently ob-\ntain high quality inference. This challenge can be partially\nattributed to the fact that people usually maintain diverse\nsocial relationships, in order to tap into diverse informa-\ntion and knowledge. It is unlikely that a person can possess\nall interests of her or his social neighbors. Instead, s/he\nmay selectively acquire just a subset of them. This paper\nintends to improve inferring interests from neighbors given\nthis observation. We conduct this study by implementing a\nprivacy-preserving large distributed social sensor system in\na large global IT company to capture the multifaceted ac-\ntivities (e.g., emails, instant messaging, social bookmarking,\netc.) of 25K+ people. These activities occupy the major-\nity of employees' time, and thus, provide a higher quality\nview of the diverse aspects of their interests compared to the\nfriending activity on online social networking sites. In this\npaper, we propose a technique that exploits the correlation\namong the attributes a person can possess to improve social-\ncorrelation-based inference quality. Our technique oers two\nunique contributions. First, we demonstrate that the pro-\nposed technique can signicantly improve inference quality\nby as much as 76.1%. Second, we study the interaction be-\ntween the two factors of the technique: social correlation\nand attribute correlation under dierent situations, in order\nto inform practical applications how the inference quality of\nour technique would change in the various situations."

We examine the strategic implications of one emerging wireless technology: utilizing multiple access points (APs) simultaneously. Clients using this technology require up-to-date information about the expected delays at available APs, which can be obtained through active probing. We model this scenario as a load balancing game, augmented to incorporate abstractions of these two technologies. Using techniques of empirical game-theoretic analysis, we evaluate a range of plausible strategies through simulation. We find that variants of the Hedge algorithms, previously shown effective at the single unit load balancing game under the bulletin board model, remain promising for scheduling multiple jobs per period; however, when delay information can only be obtained from using or probing an access point, all variants of the Hedge algorithm we examined were outperformed by simple decision-theoretic optimization policies."

They form a large class that includes the Voter models and many others. By introducing a rare Poisson noise term to the signaling protocol of the NG, the resulting Markov Chain model called Noisy Naming\nGame (NNG) is ergodic, in which all partial consensus states are recurrent. By this generic method, any member of a large class\nof agent-based network models, including the Voter models and Bass models, is easily changed from a totally synchronous system to a partially synchronous one where even after reaching total consensus, the network revisits multi-namestates infinitely often. The method introduced here works on any underlying network topology including small world and scale-free ones. Furthermore, by organizing the partially-synchronized namestates / microstates according to their coarse-grained total probability, which counts\nthe number of namestates associated with a macrostate / community structure (CS) weighted by their microstate probability, the NNG\noffers a new method for ranking competing CS in social interactions, that is not based entirely on hierarchical modularity or other ways for counting the number of intra vs inter group links in the social network. In fact, the coarse-grained CS incorporates entropic effects since its entropy is enumerated as the logarithm of the relative number of namestates it contains. As such, the Gibbs free energy is taken here to represent a good measure of overall social tension, arising from the ways in which different possibly overlapping subgroups choose and maintain differing opinions. Through simulations the NNG is shown to also successfully resolve\nthe smallest groups.\n"

Three sociological mechanisms are over-viewed: assortative mechanisms that draw attention to the role of actors attributes, relational mechanisms that emphasize the influence of existing relationships and network positions, and proximity mechanisms that focus on the social organization of interaction."

Here, we extend that research by examining\nthe link between the collective response of experts and day-to-day\nmovements of prices in the market, specifically market volatility. Our\nstudy introduces a novel method that focuses on extracted keyword\nbundles rather than single preselected keywords, and uses original\ndata covering the content of instant messages among all day traders\nat a trading firm. Day traders are an informed population who use\ninstant messages to reason out the impact of news on market behav-\nior, making them a unique source of expert informationvox exper-\ntorum. Analyses show that the extracted keywords reduce to three\nkeyword bundles, communities of unique co-occurring keywords, of\nwhich two bundles convey traders collective response to volatility.\nDay-to-day movements of keyword bundle one and keyword bun-\ndle two are associated to day-to-day movements of same day and\nnext day volatility, respectively. When the level of volatility is high,\nkeyword bundle one dominates, and when volatility is low keyword\nbundle two dominates the collective response. Finally, we find that\nresponse consensus is positively related to collective trading per-\nformance. Single keywords do not reproduce these findings. We\nconclude that e-communication among traders is a product of mass\ncollaboration over diverse viewpoints that embodies unique informa-\ntion about their collective understanding about current and future\nmarket dynamics."

What are the fundamental techniques that can be used to reduce such uncertainty and achieve reasonable KD and IE performance on the WWW? What is the impact of each novel method? What types of interactions can be conducted between these techniques and information networks to make them benefit from each other? In what way can we utilize the results in more interesting applications? What are the remaining challenges and what are the possible ways to address these challenges?

We elaborate three specific forms of collaborative ranking, namely, micro collaborative ranking (MiCR), macro collaborative ranking (MaCR) and micro-macro collaborative ranking (MiMaCR). Experiments on entity linking task show that our proposed scheme is indeed effective and promising.\n"

We present a simple, low-cost but effective comment-guided learning approach to exploit such knowledge declaratively in an automatic assessor. Our approach only requires a small set of training data, together with comments which are naturally available from human assessment. To demonstrate the power and generality of this approach, we apply the method in two very different applications: name translation and residence slot filling.  Our approach achieved significant absolute improvement (15% for name translation and 8% for slot filling) over state-of-the-art slot filling systems. It also outperformed previous methods such as recognizing textual entailment (RTE) based fact validation. Furthermore, it can be used as feedback to significantly speed up human assessment."

Further, we find that only certain forms of WOM are associated with critical take-off dynamics of product adoption.  Our tests use unique, non-public data that records the adoption dynamics for more than 180,000 randomly sampled Americans in regards to 309 newly released Hollywood movies between March 1999 and August 2001.  Our modeling strategy uses mixed methods, including statistical analysis and simulations, to provide a fuller test of our macro diffusion patterns and the micro behaviors that produce them.

        "abstract": "Although extensive studies have been conducted on online\nsocial networks (OSNs), it is not clear how to characterize information\npropagation and social influence, two types of important but not well\nde_x000C_ned social behavior. This paper presents a measurement study of\n58M messages collected from 700K users on Twitter.com, a popular social medium. We analyze the propagation patterns of general messages\nand show how breaking news (Michael Jackson's death) spread through\nTwitter. Furthermore, we evaluate di_x000B_erent social influences by examining their stabilities, assessments, and correlations. This paper addresses the complications as well as challenges we encounter when measuring\nmessage propagation and social infuence on OSNs. We believe that our results here provide valuable insights for future OSN research."

In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach towards socially-aware email. We find that the\ncurrently, email provides too little control to the recipient. Our\napproach, dubbed SoEmail, provides social context to messages\nusing an OSNs underlying social graph. This not only gives the\nrecipient control over who can message her, but it also provides\nher with an understanding of where the message came, socially.\nFurthermore, users who do not wish to use the built-in social\naspect of SoEmail, can send and receive emails without any\nchanges to their behavior. The modifications we made to the email\nto provide this social context are not invasive and can be easily\nignored by any existing web client. We built SoEmail on top of an\nexisting framework, known as Davis Social Links, which allows\nSoEmail to be completely agnostic about the underlying OSN.\nWe created a web-based, standards-based web client for SoEmail\nusing Facebook and Gmail as the underlying systems which has\nbeen released for public use and has had a good adoption rate."

Is the similarity between two\nfriends different from the similarity between any two\npeople? How does the similarity between a friend of a\nfriend compare to similarity between direct friends? In this\nwork, our goal is to answer these questions. We study the\nrelationship between semantic similarity of user profile\nentries and the social network topology. A user profile in an\non-line social network is characterized by its profile entries.\nThe entries are termed as user keywords. We develop a\nmodel to relate keywords based on their semantic relationship\nand define similarity functions to quantify the\nsimilarity between a pair of users. First, we present a\nforest model to categorize keywords across multiple\ncategorization trees and define the notion of distance\nbetween keywords. Second, we use the keyword distance to\ndefine similarity functions between a pair of users. Third,\nwe analyze a set of Facebook data according to the model\nto determine the effect of homophily in on-line social\nnetworks. Based on our evaluations, we conclude that\ndirect friends are more similar than any other user pair.\nHowever, the more striking observation is that except for\ndirect friends, similarities between users are approximately\nequal, irrespective of the topological distance between\nthem."

The third estimator (RW) is based on random\nwalkers and is generalized to estimate other graph properties.

        "abstract": "Social informatics is the core of Facebooks\nbusiness and is its most valuable asset which consists of the social\ngraph and the private data of over 500 million users. However,\nwithout secure methods of managing this data, Facebook has\nbecome vulnerable to privacy risks and devaluation. In\nFacebooks model, users are asked upon access to grant\napplications the required permissions without sufficient\nknowledge of the applications intentions. As a result, if they are\ndeceived, users risk the exposure of sensitive and personal data.\nThis paper presents a system dubbed FAITH (Facebook\nApplications: Identification, Transformation & Hypervisor) to\nmitigate or eliminate these issues by enhancing the management\nof social data. First, FAITH allows users to adjust the visibility of\ntheir social informatics for each individual application depending\non how much they trust the application. Users can configure\nFAITH to let non-trusted applications run with the least\nprivileges (least amount of social informatics) to minimize\npotential privacy leaks. Second, FAITH logs the activities of\napplications to assist users in making more secure decisions.\nUsers can closely monitor each activity performed by\napplications to adjust their privacy settings more securely. Third,\nFAITH allows users to transform their social graph such that\ndifferent applications see different social graphs preventing the\nformation of friendship inflation caused by applications. The\nimplementation of FAITH only needs the resources and tools\navailable to the public by Facebook and requires no further\ncooperation from the social network. FAITH is a prototype\nsystem: the design and concept can be extended to secure other\nOSNs (Online Social Networks). Currently, FAITH contains\nthirteen Facebook social applications and has been officially\nreleased for public usage with approximately two hundred\nmonthly active users as of now."

Our second contribution is the\nMetaDist to model the collective behavior of the users given their CDDs.

        "abstract": "In this work, we generalize the commonly-used binary (or categorical) information propagation model to describe the propagation of a continuous-value node-property in a network. Most efforts so far focus on discrete states for nodes (i.e. healthy, sick). Here, we extend the above model to describe the propagation of a node property that is characterized by a real value. As a case study, we focus on routing messages at the Internet backbone (BGP level), which we refer to as routing instability or churn. Our goal is to develop the simplest possible model that can characterize the propagation of routing instability. To capture an important routing property (routing policies), we enrich the model in a non-trivial way. Varying our small set of model parameters, we show that our model can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from fast die-out to non-zero steady-state and oscillations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that casts routing as a network-wide propagation problem and sets the stage for a theoretical analysis of routing instability, and the propagation of non-binary node properties in general."

The key question addressed here is: Is it possible to profile traf- fic at the backbone without relying on its packet and flow level information, which can be obfuscated? We propose a novel approach, called Profiling-By-Association (PBA), that uses only the IP-to-IP communication graph and information about some applications used by few IP-hosts (a.k.a. seeds). The key insight is that IP-hosts tend to communicate more frequently with hosts involved in the same application form- ing communities (or clusters). Profiling few members within a cluster can give away the whole community. Follow- ing our approach, we develop different algorithms to profile Internet traffic and evaluate them on real-traces from four large backbone networks. We show that PBAs accuracy is on average around 90% with knowledge of only 1% of all the hosts in a given data set and its runtime is on the order of minutes ( 5)."

If so, can it be used to\\tP2P accurately classify traffic in network trace data without relying on payloads or properties at the flow level? Our research shows\\tP2P that the answers to both of these questions are affirmative in\\tP2P real network trace data. Specifically, we define link homophily to be the tendency for flows with common IP hosts to have the same application (P2P, Web, etc.) compared to randomly selected flows. The presence of link homophily in trace data provides us with statistical dependencies between flows that share common IP hosts. We utilize these dependencies to classify application layer traffic without relying on payloads or properties at the flow level. In particular, we introduce a new statistical relational learning algorithm, called Neighboring Link Classifier with Relaxation Labeling (NLC+RL). Our algorithm has no training phase and does not require features to be constructed. All that it needs to start the classification process is traffic information on a small portion of the initial flows, which we refer to as seeds. In all our traces, NLC+RL achieves above 90% accuracy with less than 5% seed size; it is robust to errors in the seeds and various seed- selection biases; and it is able to accurately classify challenging traffic such as P2P with over 90% Precision and Recall."

        "abstract": "In recent years, the size of many social networks such as \nFacebook,  MySpace, and  LinkedIn has exploded at a rapid\npace, because of  its convenience in using the internet in order to\nconnect geographically disparate users. This has lead to\nconsiderable interest in many graph-theoretical aspects of social\nnetworks such as the underlying communities, the  graph diameter,\nand other structural information which can be used in order to mine\nuseful information from the social network.  The graph structure of\nsocial networks is influenced by the underlying social behavior,\nwhich can vary considerably over different  groups of individuals.\nOne of the disadvantages of existing schemes is that they attempt to\ndetermine global communities, which (implicitly) assume\nuniform behavior over the network. This is not very well suited to\nthe differences in the underlying density in different regions of\nthe social network. As a result, a global analysis over social\ncommunity structure can result in either very small communities (in\nsparse regions), or communities which are too large and incoherent\n(in dense regions). In order to handle the challenge of local\nheterogeneity, we will explore a simple property of social networks,\nwhich we refer to as the {\\\\em local succinctness property}. We will\nuse this property in order to  extract compressed descriptions of\nthe underlying community representation of the social network with\nthe use of a min-hash approach. We will show that this approach\ncreates balanced communities across a heterogeneous network in an\neffective way. We  apply the approach to a variety of  data sets,\nand illustrate its effectiveness over competing\ntechniques."

        "abstract": "In  recent years, a large  amount of  information has become\navailable online in the form of  web documents, social networks,\nblogs, or other kinds of social entities. Such networks are large,\nheterogeneous, and  often contain a huge number of links. This\nlinkage structure  encodes rich structural information about the\nunderlying topical behavior of the network. Such networks are often\n{\\\\em dynamic} and evolve rapidly over time. Much of the work in the\nliterature has focussed either on the problem of classification with\npurely text behavior, or on the problem of classification with\npurely  the  linkage behavior of the underlying graph. Furthermore,\nthe work in the literature is mostly designed for the problem of\nstatic networks.  However, a given network may be quite diverse, and\nthe use of either content or structure could be more or less\neffective in different parts of the network. In this paper, we\nexamine the problem of node classification in {\\\\em dynamic}\ninformation networks with both text content and links. Our\ntechniques  use a random walk approach in conjunction with the\ncontent of the network in order to facilitate an effective\nclassification process. This results in an effective approach which\nis more robust to variations in content and linkage structure. Our\napproach is dynamic, and can be applied to networks which are\nupdated incrementally.  Our results suggest that an approach which\nis based on a combination of content and links is extremely robust\nand effective. We present experimental results illustrating the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our approach."

In order to calculate\nthe correlation scores for many events in a large network, we\ndevelop a scalable framework, called gScore, using sampling\nand approximation. By comparing to the situation where\nevents are randomly distributed in the same network, our\nmethod is able to discover events that are highly correlated\nwith the graph structure. gScore is scalable; it can accomplish\none proximity estimation in 0.2 second on a graph with\n10 million nodes. gScore was successfully applied to the coauthor\nDBLP network and social networks extracted from\nTaoBao.com, the largest online shopping network in China,\nwith many interesting discoveries."

        "abstract": "Complex social and information network search becomes impor-\ntant with a variety of applications. In the core of these applications,\nlies a common and critical problem: Given a labeled network and\na query graph, how to efficiently search the query graph in the tar-\nget network. The presence of noise and the incomplete knowledge\nabout the structure and content of the target network make it unre-\nalistic to find an exact match. Rather, it is more appealing to find\nthe top-k approximate matches.\nIn this paper, we propose a neighborhood-based similarity mea-\nsure that could avoid costly graph isomorphism and edit distance\ncomputation. Under this new measure, we prove that subgraph sim-\nilarity search is NP hard, while graph similarity match is polyno-\nmial. By studying the principles behind this measure, we found an\ninformation propagation model that is able to convert a large net-\nwork into a set of multidimensional vectors, where sophisticated\nindexing and similarity search algorithms are available. The pro-\nposed method, called Ness (Neighborhood Based Similarity Search),\nis appropriate for graphs with low automorphism and high noise,\nwhich are common in many social and information networks. Ness\nis not only efficient, but also robust against structural noise and in-\nformation loss. Empirical results show that it can quickly and accu-\nrately find high-quality matches in large networks, with negligible\ncost."

        "abstract": "The ubiquitous graphs and networks have been established as a powerful theoretical framework for modeling various types of interactions in a variety of applications. For searching vertex sets with certain properties in large graphs, what is of interest is not only the topological structure, but also the attributes associated with the vertices. In this paper, we propose label-based proximity search for large graphs, which\naims to find the top-k vertex subsets with small diameters.  Each subset has to cover all the labels specified in a query. A naive method entails exhaustive search of all the vertices and their neighbors, which is computationally expensive. The existing greedy algorithm only returns top-1 answer with 2-approximation, and does not scale well to large graphs. As an alternative, we propose a novel framework, called gDensity, which introduces density index and likelihood ranking to solve the problem in an efficient and accurate manner. Promising vertices are ordered and examined according to their likelihood to produce high quality vertex subsets, and the likelihood calculation is greatly facilitated by density indexing. Techniques such as progressive search and approximate indexing are further proposed to enable fast pruning and efficient index construction. Experiments on real-world graph data demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed techniques. It is shown that compared to the existing algorithms, gDensity is able to reduce query response time significantly."

While the existing game system lacks the ability to predict team-level performance, the prediction models proposed in this study are expected to be a useful addition with potential applications in player and team recommendations. First, we present player and team performance metrics that can be generalized to all types of games with the concept of point gain, leveling up, and session or completion time.

We examined three different game servers from the EverQuest II game logs. In all three servers, the results from our analyses suggest that increase in social diversity in terms of characters and classes encountered moderately negatively correlates with player performance. Based on this finding, we built predictive models to predict player's future performance based on past performance and social diversity in terms of mentoring activities.

Applications using the client- server paradigm often do not perform well in such environ- ments, because they rely on the underlying MANET rout- ing protocols to provide connectivity between arbitrary end- points. However, it is often infeasible or at-least very inef- ficient to provide such connectivity in tactical MANETs. We consider content-based networking as an alternative paradigm to operate tactical MANETs. Content based networking causes information to flow based on its content rather than the identities of endpoints. This enables decoupling of infor- mation from its producers. The network assumes responsi- bility for positioning information so that it is easily accessi- ble to those who may need it. This model, rather than the classical clientserver model, is naturally suited to dynamic and disruption-tolerant tactical MANETs, since in such net- works particular endpoints are often not reachable.\nWe present Slinky, an adaptive protocol for content ac- cess in disruption-tolerant ad hoc networks, in particular tactical MANETs. Slinky relies on the community struc- ture inherent in most networks. It consists of a distributed scheme to detect and maintain dynamic communities in the network, and a scheme to replicate content across the com- munities. Slinky does not use any underlying network-wide routing, global topology or geographical information that is often unavailable in tactical MANETs. Slinky is an adap- tive and efficient content access protocol that can adapt to a wide range of mobility scenarios. We demonstrate the performance of Slinky in a few tactically relevant scenarios."

        "abstract": "The pattern of interactions between individuals in a population contains implicitly within them a remarkable amount of information. This information, if extracted, could be of significant importance in several realms such as containing the spread of disease, understanding information flow in social systems and predicting likely future interactions. A popular method of discovering structure\nin networks is through {\\\\it community detection} which attempts to capture the extent to which that network is different from a random network. However, communities are not very well defined for time-varying networks.  In this paper, we introduce the notion of spatio-temporal communities that attempts to capture the structure in spatial connections as well as temporal changes in a network.  We illustrate the notion via several examples and list the challenges in effectively discovering spatio-temporal communities. For example, such communities are lost if the temporal interactions are aggregated in a single weighted network since the concurrency information is lost.  We present an approach that first extracts concurrency information via node-clustering on each\nsnapshot. Each node is then assigned a vector of community memberships over time, which is then used to group nodes into overlapping communities via recently introduced link clustering techniques.  However we measure similarity (of nodes and edges)\nbased on concurrence, i.e. when they existed, if they existed together.  We call our approach the \\\\textit{co-community} algorithm.  We validate our approach using several real-world data sets spanning multiple contexts."

        "abstract": "In this paper we study the problem of network exchange in trust based social networks. Network exchange is of two types: Specialized Exchange and Generalized Exchange, this\ncan be characterized in terms of reciprocity, triads, graph motifs across these networks. Given the lack of standard metrics for Generalized Exchange, we propose a metric to quantify generalized exchange. We observe that the phenomenon of exchange can be used to differentiate networks. A key finding is that the manner in which the network is operationalized i.e., as cumulative network vs. active networks affects the measurement of exchange. Lastly we propose generative mechanisms for exchange in trust networks. "

        "abstract": "The main idea behind the theory of Social Capital is that social networks have value by the virtue of a persons position in the network. There is a vast amount of literature in the social sciences which deals with the success of people based on their social capital (Burt 1992). Prediction of success in games and other competitive environments has mainly focused on the behavioral as well as the performance data of the participants. Expertise and competence in such environments is defined in an analogous manner (Huffaker 2008). In this paper we take a novel approach where instead of using the previous performance or behavioral data we only use the social network information to predict the relative success and failure of players. As a baseline, we do use these two types of data for comparison in addition to using the player characteristics for prediction. We use Ron Burts Network Constraint Index and modify it to include temporal constraints with respect to the changing network structure and modify it to describe how social ties can actually form in bursts. \n\nThus we describe a computational model of social capital which can be used to predict the relative success of people in social networks. We use data from a Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game for the experiments. The advantage of using an MMO for analysis is that it offers a readymade way to compute success as compared to many offline studies where it is sometimes difficult to compare given multiple measure and metrics of success. Multiple social networks from the MMO are employed for analysis i.e., trust network, mentoring network, trade network and the adversarial network. The results from experiments show that the success of players and their leveling behavior can be predicted with a high level of accuracy by using only the social network of the players with the social capital inspired technique. Additionally the accuracy is much higher in the case of the social capital inspired technique as compared to the other techniques. While a combination of trust and the mentoring networks yield a high level of accuracy, a surprising result is that even the adversarial network gives quite good results as compared to the trade network. \n\n"

        "abstract": "Trust is almost ubiquitous in human interactions and social settings. Computational Trust refers to the operationalization of trust in settings where interaction between people are mediated via a computer or computing infrastructure. The problem of computational trust has been extensively studied in the literature, especially the problems of trust inference and trust propagation. Over the last two decades the internet has grown exponentially and with the advent of Web 2.0 and other internet technologies the number of possible ways in which people can interact with one another has also grown exponentially. Consequently a need to determine what are the sources of information and people that can be trusted and in which types of environments one should trust them has arisen. However to the best of our knowledge the problem of determining the propensity to trust has not been addressed before (Golbeck 2009) in the literature on trust even though There are now many environments on the web where people can explicitly specify trust in other people (Massa 2005, Artz 2007).\n\nWe introduce the problem of Trust Propensity Prediction. The problem of predicting and inferring trust in social networks has been studied in many domains. Given a social network with partial information about who trusts whom, the problem of trust propensity prediction is to make predictions about trust for people in the rest of the network. In this paper we describe a new problem related to predicting another aspect of social trust -predicting self-reported trust propensity. This problem can be described as the problem of predicting how much a person reports what their propensity to trust others. We use data from a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) called EverQuest II for studying the problem of predicting trust propensity. The data is in the form of unobtrusive behavioral data as well as survey data of more than seven thousand player.\nWe explored a number of approaches to address the problem of trust propensity prediction: Considering the (i) Intrinsic characteristics e.g., gender, race etc (ii) Ascribed characteristics e.g., expertise (iii) Social network of the players, (iv) History of interaction with other players in terms of grouping, socializing, mentoring and even trade and (v) Trust related behavior of the players i.e., how much they trust other players with respect to giving other players access to their virtual possessions in the. It is observed that highest accuracy is observed when trust propensity can be predicted by considering the network neighborhood of players in combination with their trust related behaviors. We also address the issue of data quality with respect to self-reported trust and how the self-report bias can be reduced by considering additional information about the respondents to identify disassemblers in the data.\n"

As such, latency is an important attribute contributing to quality-of-information (QoI) in these systems. A key question is how much work can be completed on time given some amount of distributed resources and the logical workflow topology of the data fusion graph. To answer this question, this paper presents the concept of realtime capacity; a performance metric in line with the recently introduced operational information content capacity (OICC) of a networked data fusion system. It extends results developed by the authors recently in the real-time systems community to analyze the capacity of various data fusion workflow topologies. A simple closed-form expression for a topology-dependent realtime capacity bound is derived and is shown to be accurate via extensive simulations.\n"

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of transfer learning from text to images in the context of network data in which link based bridges are available to transfer the knowledge between the dierent domains. The problem of classication of image data is often much more challenging than text data because of the following two reasons: (a) Labeled text data is very widely available for classication purposes. On the other hand, this is often not the case for image data, in which a lot of images are available from many sources, but many of them are often not labeled. (b) The image features are not directly related to semantic concepts inherent in class\nlabels. On the other hand, since text data tends to have natural semantic interpretability (because of their human origins), they are often more directly related to class labels. The semantic challenges of image features are glaringly evident, when we attempt to recognize complex abstract concepts, and the visual features often fail to discriminate such concepts. However, the copious availability of bridging relationships between text and images in the context of web and social network data can be used in order to design for effective classiers for image data. The relationships between the images and text features (which may be derived from\nsuch web-centered bridges) provide additional hints for the classication process in terms of the image feature transformations\nwhich provide the most eective results. One of our goals in this paper is to develop a mathematical model for the functional relationships between text and image features, so as to indirectly transfer semantic knowledge through feature transformations. This feature transformation is accomplished by mapping instances from dierent domains into a common space of unspecied topics. This is used as a bridge to semantically connect the two heterogeneous spaces. We evaluate our knowledge transfer techniques on an image classication task with labeled text corpora and show the eectiveness with respect to competing algorithms.\n"

        "abstract": "In recent years, knowledge transfer algorithms have become one of most the active research areas in learning visual concepts. Most of the existing transfer learning algorithms focuses on leveraging the knowledge transfer process which is specific to a given category. However, in many cases, such a process may not be very effective when a particular target category has very few samples. In such cases, it is interesting to examine, whether it is feasible to use cross-category knowledge for improving the learning process by exploring the knowledge in correlated categories. Such a task can be quite challenging due to variations in semantic similarities and differences between categories, which could either help or hinder the cross-category learning process. In order to address this challenge, we develop a cross-category label propagation algorithm, which can directly propagate the inter-category knowledge at instance level between the source and the target categories. Furthermore, this algorithm can automatically detect conditions\nunder which the transfer process can be detrimental to the learning process. This provides us a way to know when the transfer of cross-category knowledge is both useful and desirable. We present experimental results on real image and video data sets in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n"

This paper develops a hierarchical modeling methodology for open cyber-physical systems that combines techniques in estimation theory with those in data mining to reliably capture complex system behavior at different levels of abstraction. Our technique is also novel in the sense that it provides a measure of confidence in predictions. An application to green transportation is discussed, where the goal is to reduce vehicular fuel consumption and carbon footprint. First-principle models of cyber-physical systems can be very complex and include a large number of parameters, whereas empirical regression models are often unreliable when a high number of parameters is involved. Our new modeling technique, called the Sparse Regression Cube, simultaneously (i) partitions sparse, high-dimensional measurements into subspaces within which reliable linear regression models apply and (ii) determines the best reliable model for each partition, quantifying uncertainty in output prediction.\nEvaluation results show that the framework significantly improves modeling accuracy compared to previous approaches\nand correctly quantifies prediction error, while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.\n"

PhotoNet is motivated by the needs of disaster-response applications, where a group of survivors and first responders may survey damage and send images to a rescue center in the absence of a functional communication infrastructure. The protocol runs on mobile devices, handling opportunistic forwarding (when they come in contact) and in-network storage. It assigns priorities to images for forwarding and replacement depending on the degree of similarity (or dissimilarity) among them. Prioritization aims at reducing semantic redundancy such as\nthat between pictures of the same scene taken from slightly different angles. This is in contrast to redundancy among identical objects and among time series data. We evaluate PhotoNet in an emulated disaster recovery scenario, with a predetermined set of problem locales that need attention. Humans with camera phones form a mobible camera sensor network. Not all pictures make it to the rescue center because of resource constraints. At the rescue center, the utility of the camera network is measured by the number\nof problem locales of which the center becomes aware as a function of time. A better network delivers awareness of\nmore trouble locales sooner. We show that, in resource constrained networks, reducing semantic redundancy can significantly\nimprove utility. Users of the demo will be allowed to interact with both a simulator and a small set of mobile phones to understand the impact of network and protocol parameters on situation awareness.\n"

        "abstract": "Sensor networks are often redundant by design; this is often done in order to achieve reliability in information processing. In many cases, the redundancy relationships between the different sensors are known. These redundancy relationships can be represented as virtual linkages among the different sensors. These virtual linkages correspond to an information network of sensors, in which it may often be desirable to know the least redundant sensors in order to maximize the information which is obtained at the least possible cost. In this paper, we formulate the problem of sensor selection when redundancy relationships between sensors can be formulated through information network modeling. The use of external linkage information as an approach to improve the efficiency of very large scale sensor selection is a unique feature of this paper, which has not been discussed in earlier works. We present methods for efficient sensor network selection by using regression models to estimate predictability and redundancy, and we utilize the estimation for the selection process. We design efficient theoretical models, including a greedy approximation algorithm and an integer programming formulation for sensor selection. Our greedy selection algorithm provides an approximation bound of (e-1)/(2e-1), where e is the base of the natural logarithm. We show that our approach is much more effective than baseline sampling strategies. We\npresent experimental results that illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.\n"

We consider data fusion applications that try to estimate or predict some current or future state of a complex physical world. Examples include target tracking, path planning, and sensor node localization. Rather than optimizing generic network-level metrics such as latency or throughput, we achieve more resource efficient sensor network operation by directly optimizing an application-level notion of quality, namely prediction error. This is done while accommodating cost constraints. Unlike prior cost sensitive prediction/regression schemes, our solution considers more complex prediction problems that arise in sensor networks where phenomena behave differently under different conditions, and where both ordered and unordered predictors are used. The scheme is evaluated through real sensor network applications in localization and path planning. Experimental results show that non-trivial cost savings can be achieved by our scheme compared to popular cost-insensitive schemes, and a significantly better prediction error can be achieved compared to the cost-sensitive linear regression schemes.\n"

Recently, large numbers of Wikipedia users have collaborated to produce more structured information in the online encyclopedia. For example, the information found in tables, categories and infoboxes. Infoboxes contain key-value pairs, manually appended to articles based on the unstructured text therein. The wiki contains some structured information which can be crawled by DBpedia [2], which attempts to organize wiki data into into a database of subject-predicate-object triples. By leveraging this data we generate an interface, which we call WiGipedia, embedded on every Wikipedia article as an interactive graph visualization where entities represent articles, categories and relational entities, with typed edges be- tween them. This intelligent web interface is designed to simplify the elicitation of semantically structured information in Wikipedia. Our motivation is to both inform the user of interesting contextual information pertaining to the current article, and to provide a simple way to introduce and/or repair semantic relations between wiki articles. User actions result in improved accuracy and consistency of structured data spread across multiple articles. WiGipedia provides users with an intuitive interface that allows single-click Wikipedia edits without knowledge of the Wikipedia markup language, templates, etc. An online demo of the interface can be found at www.wigipedia-online.com."

A range of visualization types and control mechanisms to support knowledge discovery are presented. These include corpus and document specific views, iterative topic modeling, search, and visual filtering. Drill-down functionality is provided to allow analysts to visualize individual document sections and their relations within the global topic space. Analysts can search across a data set through a set of expansion techniques on selected document and topic nodes. Furthermore, analysts can select relevant subsets of documents and perform real-time topic modeling on these subsets to interactively visualize topics at various levels of granularity, allowing for a better understanding of the documents. A discussion of the design and implementation choices for each visual analysis technique is presented. This is followed by a discussion of three diverse use cases in which TopicNets enables fast discovery of information that is otherwise hard to find. These include a corpus of 50,000 successful NSF grant proposals, 10,000 publications from a large research center, and single documents including a grant proposal and a PhD thesis."

        "abstract": "Gold farming and real money trade refer to a set of illicit practices in massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) whereby players accumulate virtual resources to sell for real world money. Prior work has examined trade relationships formed by gold farmers but not the trust relationships which exist between members of these organizations. We adopt a hypergraph approach to model the multi-modal relationships of gold farmers granting other players permission to use and modify objects they own. We argue these permissions reflect underlying trust relationships which can be analyzed using network analysis methods. We compare farmers trust networks to the trust networks of both unidentified farmers and typical players. Our results demonstrate that gold farmers networks are different from trust networks of normal players whereby farmers trust highly-central non-farmer players but not each other. These findings have implications for augmenting detection methods and re-evaluating theories of clandestine behavior."

        "abstract": "Clandestine, covert, dark and illicit organizations are primarily characterized by the need to engage in coordination and collective action while also emphasizing secrecy and security (Ayling, 2009). Whether the object is to study hooligans and petty criminals, entrepreneurial drug traffickers and crime rings, or violent criminals and terrorists, understanding how these clandestine organizations are assembled and sustained has clear application in law enforcement and national security as well as being of considerable theoretical interest for testing the boundary conditions of organizing and communicating. As with any organization, the structure of both online and offline clandestine organizations are shaped by shared goals, task demands, environmental factors, and skills of its members (McIntosh, 1975). However, empirical analyses of offline clandestine organizations structures have received scant attention because traditional data collection is difficult by design.\n\nHowever, the explosion of behavioral data available in online databases has opened up new avenues of social research. Because the organizations that operate MMOGs maintain archival databases of all player actions and attributes, it is possible to analyze comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal behavioral data on a scale that would be unethical or impracticable to do in the offline world. To the extent that individuals in online worlds operate under similar social and psychological motivations and constraints as the offline world, it is possible to use generative models of clandestine networks from online virtual worlds to test and inform theories of clandestine networks in offline contexts (Williams, 2010). We use gold farmers in massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) as a case to examine how clandestine organizations assemble and maintain their operations in the face of pressure to remain competitive and secret.\n\nWe adopt an organizational network theory perspective to understand how networks are both the sources of structure as well as carriers of process which constrain and enable clandestine activity (Robins, 2009). Studies of clandestine organizations employ methods which censor their embeddedness within particular historical contexts and larger licit spheres of peripheral and legitimate actors. Moreover, these studies rely on descriptive, single-level methods rather than using generative and confirmatory models for multi-level, multi-theoretical analysis of how network topology and actors attributes influence each other (Contractor, Wasserman, & Faust, 2006). Generative models also allow researchers to compare networks of vastly different scales and constituent members to assess whether similar underlying processes influenced the structure.\n\nWe review our recent research findings employing methods in network analysis and machine learning to detect and identify gold farmers in a popular MMOG based on distinct structural motifs in trade exchanges, patterns of behavioral similarity, and appropriation of in-game affordances. Although these findings on virtual clandestine organizations comport with many existing theoretical predictions as well as observations from offline criminal behavior, we discuss how they fail to map from online to offline in other contexts. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of attempting to develop abstract heuristics for identifying clandestine behavior in data rich contexts and conclude by identifying future directions for analytic and theoretical research.\n\n"

Networks in particular are growing in importance as a lens onto how individuals behave and organizations\noperate. It seems appropriate that network analysis methods could also be applied to understand how clandestine or criminal organizations, such as drug traffickers and terrorist cells, coordinate and adapt while avoiding detection. Yet, the hidden nature of the relationships in these dark networks necessarily implies that collecting and analyzing complete or even representative data on these networks is very difficult."

It combined self-reported survey data with unobtrusive behavioral data from server logs of a large virtual world, EverQuest II. Over 5,000 players were surveyed about how they use the Internet, their specific activities in the virtual world, and their psychosocial well-being. In-game communication networks were also constructed and analyzed. The results showed support for both time displacement and social augmentation effects for various activities. Whether Internet and MMO use were associated with negative or positive outcomes was largely dependent on the purposes, contexts and individual characteristics of users. The results suggest that Internet use and game play have significant nuances and should not be considered as monolithic sources of effects. "

The findings, based on survey and behavioral data from over 3,500 players, illustrate how MMOGs may support trust development. Trust was higher within closer social circles: trust was highest in teammates, followed by other players across the game, followed by others online. Self-disclosure was positively related to trust of teammates and others in the game, while voice chat was only related to teammate trust. These findings indicate that social structures and communication processes contribute to trust development in MMOGs, supporting the claim that these online spaces provide social support that is unavailable in other societal realms.\n\n"

An additional, more radical form of scholarship has also emerged, namely, using virtual worlds to study real-world behaviors. If valid, this would enable using virtual worlds as petri dishes for communication scholars. However, there are several necessary conditions to be met first. The most fundamental is the establishment of a mapping principle, or the extent to which behaviors in one space are consistent with behaviors in another. This article outlines the mapping principle, spells out potential misuses, and offers a systematic exploration of validity and reliability issues. With those laid out, a research framework for mapping is presented. "

The extra complication is that the resource provides only par- tial protection, slowing down the virus propagation speed, but not stopping it completely. Just such is the case of the spread of highly resistant bacteria in the inter-hospital pa- tient transfer network. We examine exactly this problem in this paper; our contributions are: (a) we formulate and propose the problem as an optimization problem of how to best distribute resources to reduce the largest eigenvalue of the resultant adjacency matrix of the hospital-transfer net- work (b) we prove the problem is NP-complete and then propose near-optimal linear-time algorithms and finally, (c) we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm compared to several other methods after extensive exper- iments on real-world datasets including US-MEDICARE and state-level interhospital patient transfer data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formulate the prob- lem, use truly nation-scale network data and principally pro- pose effective algorithms. We found that targeting resources to a small subset of nodes using our algorithm was upto 6 times more effective than distributing infection-control re- sources uniformly, contrasting with current practice."

        "abstract": "There has been considerable attention given to the increasing popularity of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMOs) in the media and in academic research. With 47 million active subscriptions (White, 2008), MMO play is rapidly entering the mainstream. Previous research concerning MMOs has examined the social interactions between players (Cole & Griffiths, 2007; Duchenaut & Moore, 2004; Ducheneaut, Moore, & Nickell, 2007), the affordances of avatar-mediated interaction (Moore, Duchenaut, & Nickell, 2007; Moore, Gathman, Ducheneaut, & Nickell, 2007), and the social processes that take place between individuals, avatars and the communities they play in (Taylor, 2006; Williams et al., 2006; Yee, 2006a). However, there is scant investigation of the titular practice of role-playing itself. Role playing online is related to earlier face-to-face practices, and can be defined as the practice of pretending to be someone else within a fictional space (Turkle, 1995). It can be undertaken to add color to an experience, as an exercise in personal growth, for coping, creativity, or for learning-centric goals. Theoretically, role playing is best investigated through the lens of Goffmans self presentation theory (Goffman, 1959) and Eriksons stages of human development (Erikson, 1959), and by considering Huizengas magic circle (Huizenga, 1949). \n\nUsing these theoretical approaches, this paper presents the results of an investigation on role playing using a novel suite of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The story unfolds in two sequential steps, each addressing a larger question. The first question is largely descriptive, asking simply Who engages in this practice? The second question is then a deeper follow up: Why do they role play?\n\n"

In this paper we study node centrality for very large graphs, up to billions of nodes and edges. Various definitions for centrality have been proposed, ranging from very simple (e.g., node degree) to more elaborate. However, measuring centrality in billion-scale graphs poses several challenges. Many of the traditional definitions such as closeness and betweenness were not designed with scalability in mind. Therefore, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to compute them both accurately and efficiently.\nIn this paper, we propose centrality measures suitable for very large graphs, as well as scalable methods to effectively compute them. More specifically, we propose effective closeness and LINERANK which are designed for billion-scale graphs. We also develop algorithms to compute the proposed centrality measures in MAPREDUCE, a modern paradigm for large-scale, distributed data processing. We present extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, which demonstrate the scalability of our approach to very large graphs, as well as interesting findings and anomalies."

That is, can we determine when a small infection will take-off and create an epidemic? Consequently then, which nodes should we immunize to prevent an epidemic? This is a very real problem, since, e.g. people have different connections during the day at work, and during the night at home. Static graphs have been studied for a long time, with numerous analytical results. Time-evolving networks are so hard to analyze, that most existing works are simulation studies. Specifically, our contributions in this paper are: (a) we formulate the problem by approximating it by a Non-linear Dynamical system (NLDS), (b) we derive the first closed formula for the epidemic threshold of timevarying graphs under the SIS model, and finally (c) we show the usefulness of our threshold by presenting efficient heuristics and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on synthetic and real data like the MIT reality mining graphs."

Unfortunately, virus writers have begun exploiting lax security in many mobile devices and subsequently developed malware exploiting proximity-based propagation mechanisms (e.g. Cabir or CommWarrior).

Problematically, many such algorithms measuring important properties of networks have asymptotic lower bounds that are quadratic, cubic, or higher in the number of vertices. For analysis of social networks, transportation networks, communication networks, and a host of others, computation is intractable. In these networks computation in serial fashion requires years or even decades. Fortunately, these same computational problems are often naturally parallel. We present here the design and implementation of a master-worker framework for easily computing such results in these circumstances. The user needs only to supply two small fragments of code describing the fundamental kernel of the computation. The framework automatically divides and distributes the workload and manages completion using an arbitrary number of heterogeneous computational resources. In practice, we have used thousands of machines and observed commensurate speedups. Writing only 31 lines of standard C++ code, we computed betweenness centrality on a network of 4.7M nodes in 25 hours."

Link prediction in such networks must model the influences between heterogenous relationships and distinguish the formation mechanisms of each link type, a task which is beyond the simple topological features commonly used to score potential links. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistically weighted extension of the Adamic/Adar measure for heterogenous information networks, which we use to demonstrate the potential benefits of diverse evidence, particularly in cases where homogeneous relationships are very sparse. However, we also expose some fundamental flaws of traditional a priori link prediction. In accordance with previous research on homogeneous networks, we further demonstrate that a supervised approach to link prediction can enhance performance and is easily extended to the heterogeneous case. Finally, we present results on three diverse, real-world heterogeneous information networks and discuss the trends and tradeoffs of supervised and unsupervised link prediction in a multi-relational setting."

In particular, detecting communities -- densely connected subsets of nodes -- in such graphs often reveals important structural information. However, most real systems evolve over time and meaningful structural patterns persist across temporal snapshots. We present a robust model of such *dynamic communities*. Detection of dynamic communities can provide insight, for example, in studying the dynamics of infectious diseases in human proximity networks, in understanding the evolution of trends in social networks, and in designing distributed routing and storage strategies in very sparse and dynamic wireless ad hoc networks.\n\nWe present an elegant algorithm for detecting dynamic communities in\ntime evolving networks based on propagation of labels. The label\npropagation algorithm (LPA) for detecting communities in static graphs\nwas introduced by Raghavan, Albert and Kumara in 2007. Our algorithm\ndetects dynamic communities by performing LPA on successive snapshots\nwhile also using information from labels assigned in previous\nsnapshots. Thus it can detect communities that persist in time. The\nalgorithm also finds all communities that a node belongs to over time,\nand therefore allows detecting communities that overlap in time. Since\nthe algorithm is online -- it operates sequentially on the temporal\nsnapshots -- it is highly scalable and there is no need to store or\nknow in advance all network snapshots. The algorithm is also\ndecentralized, i.e., nodes directly communicate with only their\nimmediate neighbors. This makes it particularly useful in designing\ndistributed protocols for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. We\npresent results demonstrating the ability of our algorithm to detect\nmeaningful dynamic communities in real networks and compare it to those\nfound by several different methods."

However, we characterize the stationary distribution in the following cases: i) the walker rate is significantly larger or smaller than the rate in which the graph changes (time-scale separation), ii) the walker rate is proportional to the degree of the node that it resides on (coupled dynamics), and iii) the degrees of node belonging to the same connected component are identical (structural constraints).

        "abstract": "In this paper we study the steady state behavior of continuous-time random walks (CTRW) on Markov dynamic networks. We consider two types of CTRWs: one that walks at a constant rate (CTRW-C) and another that walks with a rate proportional to the vertex degree (CTRW-D). We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the steady state (SS) distribution of these walkers. For CTRW-C we obtain the approximate SS distribution for either a very fast or very slow walker. We show that the behavior of CTRW-C and CTRW-D is strikingly different. Surprisingly, the steady state distribution of the fixed rate walker depends on the walker rate, which is not the case for the degree proportional walker. Such findings have direct implication on the design of algorithms to measure dynamic networks."

        "abstract": "We live in a world increasingly dominated by networks -- communications, social, information, biological etc. A central attribute of many of these networks is that they are dynamic, that is, they exhibit structural changes over time. While the practice of dynamic networks has proliferated, we lag behind in the fundamental, mathematical understanding of network dynamism. Existing research on time-varying graphs ranges from preliminary algorithmic studies (e.g., Ferreira's work on evolving graphs) to analysis of specific properties such as flooding time in dynamic random graphs. A popular model for studying dynamic graphs is a sequence of graphs arranged by increasing snapshots of time. In this paper, we study the fundamental property of reachability in a time-varying graph over time and characterize the latency with respect to two metrics, namely store-or-advance latency and cut-through latency. Instead of expected value analysis, we concentrate on characterizing the exact probability distribution of routing latency along a randomly intermittent path in two popular dynamic random graph models. Using this analysis, we characterize the loss of accuracy (in a probabilistic setting) between multiple temporal graph models, ranging from one that preserves all the temporal ordering information for the purpose of computing temporal graph properties to one that collapses various snapshots into one graph (an operation called smashing), with multiple intermediate variants. We also show how some other traditional graph theoretic properties can be extended to the temporal domain. Finally, we propose algorithms for controlling the progress of a packet in single-copy adaptive routing schemes in various dynamic random graphs."

Our experimental results show that in both settings statistical re-ranking can be used to combine automated systems to achieve better performance than the best state-of-the-art individual system (6.6% absolute improvement in F-score) and alternative combination methods. Furthermore, to create labeled data for system development and assessment, information extraction tasks often require expensive human annotators to struggle with the vast amounts of information contained within a large-scale corpus. In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of our learning-to-rank framework to combine output from multiple systems, and also demonstrate that our approach can be used to create answer keys more at a lower cost (63.5%) than labor intensive\nhuman annotation."

        "abstract": "Studies of community structure and evolution in large social networks require a fast and accurate algorithm for community detection. As the size of analyzed communities grows, complexity of the community detection algorithm needs to be kept close to linear. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) has the benefits of nearly-linear running time and easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis for efficient community detection methods. In this paper, we propose new update rule and label propagation criterion in LPA to improve both its computational efficiency and the quality of communities that it detects. The speed is optimized by avoiding unnecessary updates performed by the original algorithm. This change reduces significantly (by order of magnitude for large networks) the number of iterations that the algorithm executes. We also evaluate our generalization of the LPA update rule that takes into account, with varying strength, connections to the neighborhood of a node considering a new label. Experiments on computer generated networks and a wide range of social networks show that our new rule improves the quality of the detected communities compared to those found by the original LPA. The benefit of considering positive neighborhood strength is pronounced especially on real-world networks containing sufficiently large fraction of nodes with high clustering coefficient."

In Twitter, information is transferred primarily via a social relationship called following. Identifying users to follow who are highly relevant to a particular topic of interest can be a difficult task. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method of automatically identifying and ranking Twitter users according to their relevancy to a given topic. The algorithm combines the standard Twitter text search mechanism with information about the social relationships in the network, effectively leveraging the opinions of the crowd. We performed a study comparing the ranked lists generated by the algorithm with lists provided by a commercial website specifically designed for the same purpose. Our initial findings show a good potential for automatically identifying interesting and relevant users."

Here, we observe the formation and evolution of networks by monitoring the\naddition of all new links, and we analyze quantitatively the tendencies used to create ties in these evolving\nonline affiliation networks. We show that an accurate estimation of these probabilistic tendencies can be\nachieved only by following the time evolution of the network. Inferences about the reason for the\nexistence of links using statistical analysis of network snapshots must therefore be made with great\ncaution. Here, we start by characterizing every single link when the tie was established in the network.\nThis information allows us to describe the probabilistic tendencies of tie formation and extract meaningful\nsociological conclusions. We also find significant differences in behavioral traits in the social tendencies\namong individuals according to their degree of activity, gender, age, popularity, and other attributes. For\ninstance, in the particular data sets analyzed here, we find that women reciprocate connections 3 times as\nmuch as men and that this difference increases with age. Men tend to connect with the most popular\npeople more often than women do, across all ages. On the other hand, triangular tie tendencies are similar,\nindependent of gender, and show an increase with age. These results require further validation in other\nsocial settings. Our findings can be useful to build models of realistic social network structures and to\ndiscover the underlying laws that govern establishment of ties in evolving social networks."

        "abstract": "Prior research has provided some evidence of social correlation (i.e., \\\\you are who you know*), which makes it possible to infer one's interests from his or her social neighbors. However, it is also shown to be challenging to consistently obtain high quality inference.  This challenge can be partially attributed to the fact that people usually maintain diverse social relationships, in order to tap into diverse information and knowledge. It is unlikely that a person would possess all interests of his/her social neighbors. Instead, s/he may selectively acquire just a subset of them. This paper in- tends to improve inferring interests from neighbors given this observation. We conduct this study by implementing a privacy-preserving large distributed social sensor system in a large global IT company to capture the multifaceted activities (e.g., emails, instant messaging, social bookmarking, etc.) of 25K+ people. These activities occupy the majority of employees' time, and thus, provide a higher quality view of the diverse aspects of their professional interests compared to the friending activity on online social networking sites. In this paper, we propose a technique that exploits the correlation among the attributes that a person possesses to improve social-correlation-based inference quality. Our technique offers two unique contributions. First, we demonstrate that the proposed technique can significantly improve inference quality by as much as 76.1%. Second, we study the interaction between the two factors: social correlation and attribute correlation under different situations. The results can inform practical applications how the inference quality would change in various scenarios."

For datasets that dont fit even on a\nsingle disk, parallelism is a first class option. In this paper we ex-\nplore MapReduce for clustering this kind of data. The main ques-\ntions are (a) how to minimize the I/O cost, taking into account the\nalready existing data partition (e.g., on disks), and (b) how to mini-\nmize the network cost among processing nodes. Either of them may\nbe a bottleneck. Thus, we propose the Best of both Worlds  BoW\nmethod, that automatically spots the bottleneck and chooses a good\nstrategy. Our main contributions are: (1) We propose BoW and\ncarefully derive its cost functions, which dynamically choose the\nbest strategy; (2) We show that BoW has numerous desirable fea-\ntures: it can work with most serial clustering methods as a plugged-\nin clustering subroutine, it balances the cost for disk accesses and\nnetwork accesses, achieving a very good tradeoff between the two,\nit uses no user-defined parameters (thanks to our reasonable de-\nfaults), it matches the clustering quality of the serial algorithm, and\nit has near-linear scale-up; and finally, (3) We report experiments\non real and synthetic data with billions of points, using up to 1; 024\ncores in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, our Yahoo! web\nis the largest real dataset ever reported in the database subspace\nclustering literature.

Our model is able to reproduce many features of the edit dynamics observed on Wikipedia; in particular, it captures the observed rise in the edit rate, followed by 1=t decay. Despite differences in the media, we also document similar features in the comment rates for a segment of the LiveJournal blogosphere."

In this work,\nwe present a new model, the Low-Rank Gaussian Mixture Model (LRGMM), for modeling data which can be extended to identifying\npartitions or overlapping clusters. The curse of dimensionality that arises in calculating the covariance matrices of the GMM is countered by using low-rank perturbed diagonal matrices. The efficiency is comparable to the diagonal approximation, yet one can capture correlations among the dimensions. Our experiments reveal the LRGMM to be an efficient and highly applicable tool for working with large high-dimensional datasets."

We introduce a new, generalized fact-finding framework able to incorporate this additional information into the fact-finding process.

        "abstract": "This demonstration presents Apollo, a new sensor information processing tool for uncovering likely facts in noisy participatory sensing data. Participatory sensing, where users proactively document and share their observations, has received significant attention in recent years as a paradigm for crowd-sourcing observation tasks. However, it poses interesting challenges in assessing confidence in the information received. By borrowing clustering and ranking tools from data mining literature, we show how to group data into sets (or claims), corroborating specific events or observations, then iteratively assess both claim and source credibility, ultimately leading to a ranking of described claims by their likelihood of occurrence. Apollo belongs to a category of tools called fact-finders. It is the first fact-finder designed and implemented specifically for participatory sensing. Apollo uses Twitter as the underlying engine for sharing participatory sensing data. Twitter is widely popular, can be interfaced to cell-phones that share sensor data, and comes with a powerful search API, as well as a publish-subscribe mechanism. We evaluate it using a participatory sensing application that collects and posts noisy vehicular traffic data on Twitter, as well as a set of 60,000 (human) tweets collected during the Haiti tsunami and a set of 500,000 tweets collected about Cairo during its recent unrest. Viewers of the demonstration will interact with Apollo for various fact-finding tasks."

        "abstract": "When information sources are unreliable, information networks have been used in data mining literature to uncover facts from large numbers of complex relations between noisy variables. The approach relies on topology analysis of graphs, where nodes represent pieces of (unreliable) information and links represent abstract relations. Such topology analysis was often empirically shown to be quite powerful in extracting useful conclusions from large amounts of poor-quality information.  However, no systematic analysis was proposed for quantifying the accuracy of such conclusions. In this paper, we present, for the first time, a Bayesian interpretation of the basic mechanism used in fact-finding from information networks. This interpretation leads to a direct quantification of the accuracy of conclusions obtained from information network analysis. Hence, we provide a general foundation for using information network analysis not only to heuristically extract likely facts, but also to quantify, in an analytically-founded manner, the probability that each fact or source is correct. Such probability constitutes a measure of quality of information (QoI). Hence, the paper presents a new foundation for QoI analysis in information networks, that is of great value in deriving information from unreliable sources. The framework is applied to a representative fact-finding problem, and is validated by extensive simulation where analysis shows significant improvement over past work and great correspondence with ground truth."

When\nmobile users move and contact each other opportunistically, they\nform a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN), which can be exploited to\nshare data among them. Data replication is one of the common\ntechniques for such data sharing.

We analytically formulate\nthe contact duration aware data replication problem and give a\ncentralized solution to better utilize the limited storage buffers and\nthe contact opportunities. We further propose a practical contact\nDuration Aware Replication Algorithm (DARA) which operates\nin a fully distributed manner and reduces the computational\ncomplexity.

        "abstract": "Data access is an important issue in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), and a common technique to improve the performance of data access is cooperative caching. However, due to the unpredictable node mobility in DTNs, traditional caching schemes cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose DAC, a novel caching protocol adaptive to the challenging environment of DTNs. Specifically, we exploit the social community structure to combat the unstable network topology in DTNs. We propose a new centrality metric to evaluate the caching capability of each node within a community, and solutions based on this metric are proposed to determine where to cache. More importantly, we consider the impact of the contact duration limitation on cooperative caching, which has been ignored by the existing works. We prove that the marginal caching benefit that a node can provide diminishes\nwhen more data is cached. We derive an adaptive caching bound for each mobile node according to its specific contact patterns with others, to limit the amount of data it caches. In this way, both the storage space and the contact opportunities are better utilized. To mitigate the coupon collectors problem, network coding techniques are used to further improve the caching efficiency. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that our cooperative caching protocol can significantly improve the performance of data access in DTNs. "

To deal with this problem, we apply data\nreplication techniques.

The goal is to stabilize all queues and optimize a utility function of time average attributes, subject to an additional set of time average constraints.

Every frame, the controller observes a new random event and then chooses a control action based on this observation.  The current state, random event, and control action together affect:  (i) the frame size, (ii) a vector of penalties incurred over the frame, and (iii)  the transition probabilities to the next state visited at the end of the frame.   The goal is to minimize the time average of one penalty subject to time average constraints on the others. This problem has applications to task scheduling in computer systems and wireless networks,  where each task can take a different amount of time and may change the state of the network.  An example is energy-optimal scheduling in a system with several energy-saving transmission modes, where transitions to a different mode incur energy and/or delay penalties. We pose the problem as a stochastic linear fractional program and present an online Lyapunov drift method for solving it. For large classes of problems, the solution can be implemented without any knowledge of the random event probabilities."

Most community detection algorithms use the links between the nodes in order to determine the dense regions in the graph. These dense regions are the communities of social media in the graph. Such methods are typically based purely on the linkage structure of the underlying social media network. However, in many recent applications, edge content is available in order to provide better supervision to the community detection process. Many natural representations of edges in social interactions such as shared images and videos, user tags and comments are naturally associated with content on the edges. While some work has been done on utilizing node content for community detection, the presence of edge content presents unprecedented opportunities and flexibility for the community detection process. We will show that such edge content can be leveraged in order to greatly improve the effectiveness of the community detection process in social media networks. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of our approach."

With mere minutes of manual work, one may start with a raw stream of\nrecords representing a network and progress through hundreds of steps to generate plots, gigabytes\nor terabytes of output, and actionable or publishable results."

Previous research addressing this issue suggests that the network range of the people involved in the edge, the extent to which the edge is embedded in a surrounding structure, and the age of the edge all play a role in edge decay. This paper uses weighted data from a large-scale social network built from cell-phone calls in an 8-week period to determine the importance of edge weight for the decay/persistence process. In particular, we study the relative predictive power of directed weight, embeddedness, newness, and range (measured as outdegree) with respect to edge decay and assess the effectiveness with which a simple decision tree and logistic regression classifier can accurately predict whether an edge that was active in one time period continues to be so in a future time period. We find that directed edge weight, weighted reciprocity and time-dependent measures of edge longevity are highly predictive of whether we classify an edge as persistent or decayed, relative to the other types of factors at the dyad and neighborhood level."

In particular, we first explore the interplay between the social network and user tweet topics and offer evidence that suggests that users who are close in the social graph tend to tweet about similar topics. We then analyze the implicit retweet network and find highly unreciprocal links and unbalanced triads. We also explain the effects of these structural patterns on information diffusion by analyzing and visualizing how URLs tend to be tweeted and retweeted. Finally, given our analyses of the social network and the retweet network, we provide some insights into the relationships between these two networks. "

The focus of this work is defining the Operational Information Content Sum Capacity (OICC-S) of a network, as the set of QoI-vectors supported which maximize sum utility of the system. This utility is defined as a function of the QoI attributes provided by the source input, as well as the channel induced attributes that impact the QoI delivered to the destination(s). Optimum rate allocation to maximize the output sum utility and achieve OICC-S of the network is provided, and demonstrated to differ from the solution that provides maximum throughput."

Instantaneous channel states are never known, and all control decisions are based on information provided by ACK/NACK feedback from past transmissions. This system can be viewed as a restless multi-armed bandit problem with a concave objective function of the time average reward vector. Such problems are generally intractable. However, we provide an approximate solution by optimizing the concave objective over a non-trivial inner bound on the network performance region, where the inner bound is constructed by randomizing well- designed stationary policies. Using a new frame-based Lyapunov drift argument, we design a policy of admission control and chan- nel selection that stabilizes the network with throughput utility that can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal in the inner performance region. Our problem has applications in limited channel probing in wireless networks, dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks, and target tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles. Our analysis generalizes the MaxWeight-type scheduling policies in stochastic network optimization theory from time-slotted systems to frame-based systems that have policy-dependent frame sizes."

This is an important network model to explore because channel probing may be costly or infeasible in some contexts. In this case, we can use channel memory with ACK/NACK feedback from previous transmissions to improve network throughput. Computing in closed form the capacity region of this network is difficult because it involves solving a high dimension partially observed Markov decision problem. Instead, in this paper we construct an inner and outer bound on the capacity region, showing that the bound is tight when the number of users is large and the traffic is symmetric. For the case of heterogeneous traffic and any number of users, we propose a simple queue-dependent policy that can stabilize the network with any data rates strictly within the inner capacity bound. The stability analysis uses a novel frame-based Lyapunov drift argument. The outer-bound analysis uses stochastic coupling and state aggregation to bound the performance of a restless bandit problem using a related multi-armed bandit system. Our results are useful in cognitive radio networks, opportunistic scheduling with delayed/uncertain channel state information, and restless bandit problems."

These are generalizations of traditional data networks where commodities in one or more queues can be combined to produce new commodities that are delivered to other parts of the network, and can be used to model problems such as in-network data fusion, stream processing, MapReduce scheduling, and grid computing. Scheduling actions are complicated by the underflow problem that arises when some queues with required components go empty. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology for constructing and analyzing online algorithms for such processing networks. Specifically, we develop the Perturbed Max-Weight algorithm (PMW) to achieve optimal utility. The idea of PMW is to perturb the weights used by the usual Max-Weight algorithm to push queue levels towards non-zero values (avoiding underflows). We then show, using a novel combination of Lyapunov drift analysis and duality theory, that when the perturbations are carefully chosen, PMW is able to achieve a utility that is within O(1/V ) of the optimal value for any V  1, while ensuring an average network backlog of O(V ). The methodology developed here is very general and can also be applied to other problems that involve such underflow constraints."

Starting from a collection of $n$ isolated nodes, potential edges chosen uniformly at random from the complete graph are examined one at a time while a cap, $k$, on the maximum allowed component size is enforced.  Edges whose addition would exceed size $k$ can be simply rejected provided the accepted fraction of edges never becomes smaller than a decreasing function, $g(k) = 1/2 + (2k)^{-\\\\beta}$. If the rate of decay %of $g(k)$ is sufficiently small ($\\\\beta < 1$), troublesome edges can always be rejected, and the growth in the largest component is dominated by an overtaking mechanism leading to a strongly discontinuous transition.  If $\\\\beta > 1$, once the largest component reaches size $n^{1/\\\\beta}$, troublesome edges must often be accepted, leading to direct growth dominated by stochastic fluctuations and a ``weakly* discontinuous transition."

However, it is not known whether this benefit is received by each participant node in proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence. This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced by individual nodes in a network35.We address this question by applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here we report two main results. First, nodes contribute heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a strong contributor tends to decrease overall network persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor. Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of these results to other cooperative networks by analyzing a 15-year time series of the interactions between designer and contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As with the ecological networks, a firms survival probability decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases. Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially address questions about the impact of invasive species in ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems."

While digital data uniquely captures the totality of a persons communication, past research consistently shows that a subset of contacts makes up a persons social network of unique resource providers. To address this gap, we analyzed the correspondence between self-reported social network data and email communication data with the objective of identifying the dynamics in e-communication that correlate with a persons perception of a significant network tie.  First, we examined the predictive utility of three popular methods to derive social network data from email data based on volume and reciprocity of bilateral email exchanges.  Second, we observed differences in the response dynamics of self-reported ties, allowing us to introduce and test a new method that incorporates the time-resolution information found in email transmission data.  Using a range of robustness checks for measurement and misreporting errors in self-report and email data, we find that the methods have similar predictive utility. Although e-communication has lowered communication costs with large numbers of persons, and potentially extended our number of, and reach to contacts, our case results suggest that underlying behavioral patterns indicative of friendship or professional contacts continue to operate in a classical fashion in email interactions."

Our study introduces a general method that focuses on bundles of words that behave differently from daily communication routines, and uses original data covering the content of\ninstant messages among all day traders at a trading firm over a 40-month period. Analyses show that two word bundles convey traders understanding of same day market events and potential next day market events. We find that when market volatility is high, traders communications are dominated by same day events, and when volatility is low, communications are dominated by next day events. We show that the stronger the traders attention to either same day or next day events, the higher their collective trading\nperformance. We conclude that e-communication among traders is a product of mass collaboration over diverse viewpoints that embodies unique information about their weak or strong understanding of the market."

        "abstract": "Networks from different genres are not static entities, but exhibit dynamic behavior. The congestion level of links in transportation networks varies in time depending on the traffic. Similarly, social and communication links are\nemployed at varying rates as information cascades unfold. In recent years there has been an increase of interest in modeling and mining dynamic networks. However, limited attention has been placed in high-scoring subgraph discovery in time-evolving networks.\nWe define the problem of finding the highest-scoring temporal subgraph in a dynamic network, termed Heaviest Dynamic Subgraph (HDS). We show that HDS is NP-hard even with edge weights in {-1, 1}, and devise an efficient approach for large graph instances that evolve over long time periods. While a naive approach would enumerate all O(t^2) sub-intervals, our solution performs an effective pruning of the sub-interval space by considering O(t _x0001_ log(t)) groups of sub-intervals and computing an aggregate of each group in logarithmic time. We also define a fast heuristic and a tight upper bound for approximating the static version of HDS, and use them for further pruning the sub-interval space and quickly verifying candidate sub-intervals.\nWe perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm on transportation, communication and social media networks for discovering subgraphs that correspond to traffic congestions, communication overflow and localized social discussions. Our method is two orders of magnitude faster than a naive approach and scales well with network size and time length."

However, the specific mechanism that may underlie similarities in nature and human systems has not been analyzed. Building on stochastic food-web models, we propose a parsimonious bipartite-cooperation model that reproduces the key features of mutualistic networks - degree distribution, nestedness and modularity  for both ecological networks and socio-economic networks. Our analysis uses two diverse networks. Mutually-beneficial interactions between plants and their pollinators, and cooperative economic exchanges between designers and their contractors. We find that these mutualistic networks share a key hierarchical ordering of their members, along with an exponential constraint in the number and type of partners they can cooperate with. We use our model to show that slight changes in the interaction constraints can produce either extremely nested or random structures, revealing that these constraints play a key role in the evolution of mutualistic networks. This could also encourage a new systematic approach to study the functional and structural properties of networks. The surprising correspondence across mutualistic networks suggests their broadly representativeness and their potential role in the productive organization of exchange systems, both ecological and social."

We begin with the theoretical foundation, from which we conclude that an evolution is at most as strong as its weakest link. This allows us to formulate an efficient algorithm to identify all evolutionary sequences in a dynamic social network. We use this algorithm to empirically study community evolution in several large social networks, to identify those features of the early stages of a community that indicate whether a community is going to be shortlived or not. Our results show that it is possible to correlate the lifespan of a community to structural parameters of its early evolution; these conclusions are robust across all the social networks we have investigated."

        "abstract": "The categorization of vertices in a network is a common task across a multitude of domains. Specifically, structural divisions into internally well connected sets have been shown to be useful in computer science, social science, and biology. In each of these areas, grouping vertices using structural boundaries helps one to understand the underlying processes of a network. Identifying such groupings is a non-trivial task, and a subject of intense research in recent years. In general, identifying groups of vertices in a network based on structural properties alone is known as community detection.Methods to identify such groups take a wide variety of approaches, mirroring the diversity in domains where an accurate view of structural communities is useful. Depending on the definition of a community used, one could discover groups which maximize a global quality function, contain a specific set of substructures, or satisfy a set of local criteria. Each of these definitions has resulted in a number of methods which aim to produce the best set of communities relative to the definition chosen. Rather than focusing on a number of features which differentiate these definitions and methods from each other, this text will focus on perhaps the most fundamental question in the field of community detection; should groups be disjoint or should they be allowed to overlap? In the past, the field of community detection has primarily focused on identifying a set of groups such that each vertex in the network is assigned to a single group. Such a requirement results in a set of disjoint groups covering the entire network. However, with the explosion of social network and on-line communication data available, research has expanded towards methods which consider overlapping groups. In the remainder of this text, we will first include a brief discussion on the intuition behind disjoint and overlapping communities as well as provide the reader with a basic understanding of a small sample of commonly used methods for community detection. Further into the text, we will present the difficulties involved when detecting overlapping communities and introduce a method for discovering overlapping communities which avoids these common pitfalls. This algorithm will be presented with results on real and synthetic benchmark networks. Finally, we will show that in real data, communities which do are natural and necessary to capture many of the associations between vertices in a network."

Guilt-by-association methods combine weak signals to derive stronger ones, and have been extensively used for anomaly detection and classification in numerous settings (e.g., accounting fraud, cyber-security, calling-card fraud). The focus of this paper is to compare and contrast several very successful, guilt-by-association methods: Random Walk with Restarts , Semi-Supervised Learning, and Belief Propagation (BP). Our main contributions are two-fold: (a) theoretically, we prove that all the methods result in a similar matrix inversion problem; (b) for practical applications, we developed FaBP , a fast algorithm that yields 2 speedup, equal or higher accuracy than BP, and is guaranteed to converge. We demonstrate these benefits using synthetic and real datasets, including YahooWeb, one of the largest graphs ever studied with BP."

Attributed graphs appear in real world in the form of social networks with user interests, gene interaction networks with gene expression information, phone call networks with customer demographics, and many others. In effect, we want to group the nodes into clusters with similar connectivity and homogeneous attributes. Most existing graph clustering algorithms either consider only the connectivity structure of the graph and ignore the node attributes, or require several user-defined parameters such as the number of clusters. We propose PICS, a novel, parameter-free method for mining attributed graphs. Two key advantages of our method are that (1) it requires no user-specified parameters such as the number of clusters and similarity functions, and (2) its running time scales linearly with total graph and attribute size. Our experiments show that PICS reveals meaningful and insightful patterns and outliers in both synthetic and real datasets, including call networks, political books, political blogs, and collections from Twitter and YouTube which have more than 70K nodes and 30K attributes. \n\nThis work is for I3.1."

For longer-term health outcomes such as obesity, we find that weight changes of participants are correlated with exposure to peers who gained weight in the same period, which is in direct contrast to currently accepted theories of social contagion. Finally, as a proxy for understanding health education we examine change in political opinions during the 2008 US presidential election campaign.

In this paper, we propose the novel problem of predicting mobile application (known as apps) installation using social networks and explain its challenge. Modern smart phones, like the ones used in our study, are able to collect different social networks using built-in sensors. (e.g. Bluetooth proximity network, call log network, etc) While this information is accessible to app market makers such as the iPhone AppStore, it has not yet been studied how app market makers can use these information for marketing research and strategy development. We develop a simple computational model to better predict app installation by using a composite network computed from the different networks sensed by phones. Our model also captures\nindividual variance and exogenous factors in app adoption. We show the importance of considering all these factors in predicting app installations, and we observe the surprising result that app installation is indeed predictable. We also show that our model achieves the\nbest results compared with generic approaches."

While our social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it has been impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the nature of this restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities. These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and spatial constraints."

Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the systems entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the networks degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.       "

Ideally, a truster would base its trust on the evidence of prior experiences with the trustee, but such experiences arise only for a few trustees. Thus, a truster must rely upon the propagation of trust through a path over intermediary agents, each providing a trust assessment in the next. However, existing approaches fail to address settings where a forward path isnt available and trust must be estimated based on assessments provided by the trustee itself, such as in social communities and product evaluations.\n\nWe propose Shin, a generalized trust propagation approach that incorporates a recent probabilistic method for revising trust estimates in trustees along with propagation operators that apply over paths. Shin yields higher prediction accuracy than traditional approaches."

        "abstract": "In a wide array of disciplines, data can be modeled as an interconnected network of entities along with associated attributes. Given an attributed network and a small query graph, we address the problem of efficiently finding the query graph in this network. Due to the presence of noise and incompleteness in the target network, the query graph can vary fromthe target network in terms of both topology\nand node labels. This makes the problem a very challenging one.  In this paper, we propose a neighborhood-based graph matching technique that avoids costly subgraph isomorphism and edit distance computations. We convert the neighborhood of each node into a multi-dimensional vector and then apply an iterative inference algorithm to identify the optimal matching based on both topology and label similarity. We further investigate how our generalized graph matching technique can be extended to various graph query applications, such as RDF query answering, top-k approximate matches, entity name disambiguation and large graph alignments.  The proposed method, called NeMa (Network Match), is appropriate for graphs with low automorphism and high noise, which are common in many social and information networks. NeMa is not only efficient, but also robust when the query graph varies from the target network in structure and node labels. We present experimental results to show that our approach is both accurate and efficient."

Unfortunately, OLAP queries such as iceberg cube are not well defined for graphs due to the absence of dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce graph iceberg, a concept similar to iceberg cube, but in the context of graphs. Graph icebergs refer to densely connected subgraphs where the occurrence of certain attributes is abnormally high. Graph iceberg is expensive to compute due to the inherently enormous search space in graphs. We propose gIceberg, a novel and scalable framework to define and conduct graph iceberg search. gIceberg identifies a locality property of graph iceberg: vertices in a graph iceberg shall be surrounded by vertices with similar attributes. This property inspires the development of novel indexing and pruning techniques in gIceberg, such as forward aggregation using\npivot vertices and backward aggregation using active boundary. Experimental results on real-world large graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of gIceberg."

PhotoNet is motivated by the needs of disaster-response applications, where a group of survivors and first responders may survey damage and send images to a rescue center in the absence of a functional communication infrastructure. The protocol runs on mobile devices, handling opportunistic forwarding (when they come in contact) and in-network storage. It assigns priorities to images for forwarding and replacement depending on the degree of similarity (or dissimilarity) among them, such that scarce resources are assigned to delivery of most deserving content first. Prioritization aims at reducing semantic redundancy such as that between pictures of the same scene at the same location taken from\nslightly different angles. This is in contrast to redundancy among identical objects and among time series data. PhotoNet delivers\nmore diverse pictures in terms of event coverage suppressing logically redundant content belonging to the same event.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a confidence interval quantification of maximum likelihood estimation of participant reliability in social sensing applications. The work is motivated by the emergence of social sensing as a data collection paradigm, where humans perform the data collection tasks. A key challenge in social sensing applications lies in the uncertain nature of human measurements. Unlike well-calibrated and well-tested infrastructure sensors, humans are less reliable, and the likelihood that participants' measurements\nare correct is often unknown a priori. Hence, it is hard to estimate the accuracy of conclusions made based on social sensing data. In previous work, we developed a maximum likelihood estimator of reliability of both participants and facts concluded from the data. This paper presents an analytically-founded bound that quantifies the accuracy of such maximum likelihood estimation in social sensing. A confidence interval is derived by leveraging the asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimation and computing\nthe approximation of Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the estimation parameters. The proposed quantification approach is empirically validated and shown to accurately bound the actual estimation error given sufficient number of participants under different sensing topologies."

        "abstract": "The main challenge of designing classification algorithms for sensor networks is the lack of labeled sensory data, due to the high cost of manual labeling in the harsh locales where a sensor network is normally deployed. In the field of machine learning, some algorithms have been proposed to train accurate classification models from limited labeled data. However, they are designed for centralized databases and thus cannot be applied to sensor networks since delivering all the sensory data to the sink would cost enormous energy. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical aggregate classification (HAC) protocol which can reduce the amount of data sent by each node while achieving accurate classification in the face of insufficient label information. In this protocol, each sensor node locally makes cluster analysis and forwards only its decision to the parent node. The decisions are aggregated along the tree, and eventually the global agreement is achieved at the sink node. In addition, to control the tradeoff between the communication\nenergy and the classification accuracy, we design an extended version of HAC, called the constrained hierarchical aggregate classification (cHAC) protocol. cHAC can achieve more accurate classification results compared with HAC, at the cost of more energy consumption. The advantages of our schemes are demonstrated through the experiments on not only synthetic data but also a real testbed."

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of collection and delivery of a representative subset of pictures, in participatory camera networks, to maximize coverage when a significant portion of the pictures may be redundant or irrelevant. Consider, for example, a rescue mission, where volunteers and survivors of a large-scale disaster scout a wide area to capture pictures of damage in distressed neighborhoods, using handheld cameras, and report them to a rescue station. In this participatory camera network, a significant amount of pictures may be redundant (i.e., similar pictures may be reported by many) or irrelevant (i.e., may not document an event of\ninterest). Given this pool of pictures, we aim to build a protocol to store and deliver a smaller subset of pictures, among all those taken, that minimizes redundancy and eliminates irrelevant objects and outliers. While previous work addressed removal of redundancy alone, doing so in the presence of outliers is tricky, because outliers, by their very nature, are different from other objects,\ncausing redundancy-minimizing algorithms to favor their inclusion, which is at odds with the goal of finding a representative subset. To eliminate both outliers and redundancy at the same time, two seemingly opposite objectives must be met together. The contribution of this paper lies in a new prioritization technique (and its in-network implementation) that minimizes redundancy among delivered pictures, while also reducing outliers."

        "abstract": "Software bugs in distributed systems are notoriously hard to find due to the large number of components involved and the non-determinism introduced by race conditions between messages. This paper introduces PopMine, a tool for diagnosing corner-case bugs by finding the minimal causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) of events, spanning multiple nodes, which captures a bug-triggering condition. Being based on causal order, a global notion of time is not required in uncovering bug-triggering distributed event patterns. Bug triggering event DAGs can be identified by comparing execution graphs from successful runs to those where bug manifestations were observed, and exposing the minimal discriminative event DAGs that may be responsible for the problem. This is a significant extension to prior debugging tools, in that prior work considered much simpler bug-triggering conditions such as single events, event sets, or ordered chains of events. To the authors knowledge, this is the first paper that considers bug-triggering conditions in the form of distributed event graphs. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we applied our tool to VCP, Chord and GreenGPS and diagnosed bugs. We also present simulation results to demonstrate the scalability of our approach."

        "abstract": "Provenance can play a significant role in a military information system for supporting the calculation of information trust. A nodes trust can change over time after its initial deployment due to various reasons such as energy loss, environmental conditions or exhausting sources. We introduce a node-level trust-enhancing mechanism for information networks using provenance. A unique characteristic of the proposed trust architecture presented here is the use of provenance through the path of the information from source to destination in determining the information trust. In this proposed architecture each node in the system has a trust and provenance vector. Each information item transmitted over the network has a trust value associated with it. Nodes reexamine and update the trust value associated with the information, creating a distributed system that is more flexible and more responsive. As our system allows reconfigurations, initiatives taken by the intermediate nodes such as replacement of untrusted nodes will enhance the network trust in mission critical situations faster than a centralized approach\n"

        "abstract": "This paper presents a tool ProNet, that is used to obtain the network trust based on incomplete provenance. We consider a multihop scenario where a set of source nodes observe an event and disseminate their observations as an information item through a multihop path to the command center. Nodes are assumed to embed their provenance details on the information content. Received provenance may not be complete at the command center due to attackers dropping provenance or the unavailability of provenance. We design ProNet, a tool which is at the command center that acts on the received information item to determine the information trust, node-level trust and sequence-level trust. ProNet contains three steps. In the first step it reconstructs the complete provenance details of received information from the available provenance. In the second step it employs a data classification scheme to classify the data into a good and bad pool. In the third step it employs pattern mining on the reconstructed provenance of bad data pools to\ndetermine the frequently appearing node and node sequence. This frequent appearance will quantify the trust level of nodes\nand node sequence. Now an information quality/trust level of newly received information can be determined based on the\noccurrences of these node/sequence patterns on the provenance data. We provide a detailed analysis on false positive and false\nnegatives."

        "abstract": "Mining strong correlations from transactional databases often leads to more meaningful results than mining association rules. In such mining, null (transaction)-invariance is an important property of the correlation measures. Unfortunately, some useful null-invariant measures such as Kulczynski and Cosine, which can discover correlations even for the very unbalanced cases, lack the (anti)-monotonicity property. Thus, they could only be applied to frequent itemsets as the post-evaluation step. For large datasets and for low supports, this approach is computationally prohibitive. This paper presents new properties for all known null-invariant measures. Based on these properties, we develop efcient pruning techniques and design the Apriori-like algorithm NICOMINER for mining strongly correlated patterns directly. We develop both the threshold-bounded and the top-k variations of the algorithm, where top-k is used when the optimal correlation threshold is not known in advance and to give user control over the output size. We test NICOMINER on real-life datasets from different application domains, using Cosine as an example of the null-invariant correlation measure. We show that NICOMINER outperforms support-based approach more than an\norder of magnitude, and that it is very useful for discovering top correlations in itemsets with low support."

Many supervised multi-task learning methods have been proposed, while unsupervised multitask learning is still a rarely studied problem. In this paper, we propose to learn a kernel for multi-task clustering. Our goal is to learn a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, in which the geometric structure of the data in each task is preserved, while the data distributions of any two tasks are as close as possible. This is formulated as a unied kernel learning framework, under which we study two types of kernel learning: nonparametric kernel learning and spectral kernel design. Both types of kernel learning can be solved by linear programming. Experiments on several cross-domain text data sets demonstrate that kernel k-means on the learned kernel can achieve better clustering results than traditional single-task clustering methods. It also outperforms the newly proposed multi-task clustering method."

In this paper, we present a generalized Fisher score to jointly select features. It aims at nding an subset of features, which maximize the lower bound of traditional Fisher score. The resulting feature selection problem is a mixed integer programming, which can be reformulated as a quadratically constrained linear programming (QCLP). It is solved by cutting plane algorithm, in each iteration of which a multiple kernel learning problem is solved alternatively by multivariate ridge regression and projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark data sets indicate that the proposed method outperforms Fisher score as well as many other state-of-the-art feature selection methods."

TEXplorer can be implemented within a multi-dimensional text database, where each row is associated with structural dimensions (attributes) and text data (e.g., a document). The system utilizes the text cube data model, where a cell aggregates a set of documents with matching values in a subset of dimensions. Cells in a text cube capture different levels of summarization of the documents, and can represent objects at different conceptual levels. Users query the system by submitting a set of keywords. Instead of returning a ranked list of all the cells, we propose a keywordbased interactive exploration framework that could offer exible OLAP navigational guides and help users identify the levels and objects they are interested in. A novel signicance measure of dimensions is proposed based on the distribution of IR relevance of cells. During each interaction stage, dimensions are ranked according to their signicance scores to guide drilling down; and cells in the same cuboids are ranked according to their relevance to guide exploration. We propose efcient algorithms and materialization strategies for ranking top-k dimensions and cells. Finally, extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the efciency and effectiveness of our approach."

        "abstract": "Social multimedia sharing and hosting websites, such as Flickr and Facebook, contain billions of user-submitted images. Popular Internet commerce websites such as Amazon.com are also furnished with tremendous amounts of product-related images. In addition, images in such social networks are also accompanied by annotations, comments and other information, thus forming heterogeneous image-rich information networks. In this paper, we introduce the concept of (heterogeneous) image-rich information network and the problem of how to perform information retrieval and recommendation in such networks. We propose a fast algorithm HMok-SimRank (heterogeneous minimum order k-SimRank) to compute link-based similarity in weighted heterogeneous information networks. Then, we propose an algorithm Integrated Weighted Similarity Learning (IWSL) to account for both link-based and contentbased similarities by considering the network structure and mutually reinforcing link similarity and feature weight learning. Both local and global feature learning methods are designed. Experimental results on Flickr and Amazon datasets show that our approach is signicantly better than traditional methods in terms of both relevance and speed. A new product search and recommendation system for e-commerce has been implemented based on our algorithm."

        "abstract": "Networks can be represented as evolutionary graphs in a variety of spatio-temporal applications. Changes in the nodes and edges over time may also result in corresponding changes in structural garph properties such as shortest path distances. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting the top-k most\nsignicant shortest-path distance changes between two snapshots of an evolving graph. While the problem is solvable with two applications of the all-pairs shortest path algorithm, such a solution would be extremely slow and impractical for very large graphs. This is because when a graph may contain millions of nodes, even the storage of distances between all node pairs can become inefcient in practice. Therefore, it is desirable to design algorithms which can directly determine the signicant changes in shortest path distances, without materializing the distances in individual snapshots. We present algorithms that are up to two orders of magnitude faster than such a solution, while retaining comparable accuracy.\n"

        "abstract": "Spatio-temporal data collected from GPS have become an important resource to study the relationships of moving objects. While previous studies focus on mining objects being together for a long time,\ndiscovering real-world relationships, such as friends or colleagues in human trajectory data, is a fundamentally dierent challenge. For example, it is possible that two individuals are friends but do not spend a lot of time being together every day. However, spending just one or two hours together at a location away from work on a Saturday night could be a strong indicator of friend relationship. Based on the above observations, in this paper we aim to analyze and detect semantically meaningful relationships in a supervised way. That is, with an interested relationship in mind, a user can label some object pairs with and without such relationship. From labeled pairs, we will learn what time intervals are the most important ones in order to characterize this relationship. These signicant time intervals, namely T-Motifs, are then used to discover relationships hidden in the unlabeled moving object pairs. While the search for T-Motifs could be time-consuming, we design two speed-up strategies to eciently extract T-Motifs. We use both real and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the eectiveness and eciency of our method.\n"

        "abstract": "Periodicity is one of the most frequently occurring phenomena for moving objects. Animals usually have periodic movement behaviors, such as daily foraging behaviors or yearly migration behaviors. Such periodic behaviors are the keys to understand animal movement and they also reect the seasonal, climate, or environmental changes of the ecosystem. However, periodic behaviors could be complicated, involving multiple interleaving periods, partial time span, and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. In this paper, we address the problem of mining periodic behaviors for moving objects. It involves two sub-problems: how to detect the periods in complex movements, and how to mine periodic behaviors. A period is usually a single value, such as 24 h. And a periodic behavior is a statistical description of the periodic movement for one specic period. For example, we could describe an animals daily behavior in the way that From 6 pm to 6 am, it has 90% probability staying at location A and from 7 am to 5 pm, it has 70% probability staying at location B and 30% probability staying at location C. So our tasks is to rst detect the periods and then describe each periodic behavior according to different periods. Our main assumption is that the observed movement is generated from multiple interleaved periodic behaviors associated with certain reference locations. Based on this assumption, we propose a two-stage algorithm, Periodica, to solve the problem. At the rst stage, the notion of reference spot is proposed to capture the reference locations. Through reference spots, multiple periods in the movement can be retrieved using a method that combines Fourier transform and autocorrelation. At the second stage, a probabilistic model is proposed to characterize the periodic behaviors. For a specic period, periodic behaviors are statistically generalized from partial movement sequences through hierarchical clustering. Finally, we show two extensions to the Periodica algorithm: (1) missing data interpolation, and (2) future movement prediction. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Traditional link prediction methods are designed to nd friends solely relying on social network information. With location and trajectory data available, we can generate more accurate and geographically related results, and help web-based social service users nd more friends in the real world. Aiming to recommend geographically related friends in social network, a three-step statistical recommendation approach is proposed for GPS-enabled cyber-physical social network. By combining GPS information and social network structures, we build a pattern-based heterogeneous information network. Links inside this network reect both peoples geographical information, and their social relationships. Our approach estimates link relevance and nds promising geo-friends by employing a random walk process on the heterogeneous information network. Empirical studies from both synthetic datasets and reallife dataset demonstrate the power of merging GPS data and\nsocial graph structure, and suggest our method outperforms other methods for friends recommendation in GPS-based cyberphysical social network."

Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled\nenvironments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary\nand directed to act maliciously (e.g., by performing jamming,\npacket dropping, packet flooding etc.). A trust management\nframework in a MANET is useful to infer if nodes behave in\na selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could\nbe taken, in order to maximize network performance.\nIndividual nodes in a MANET could perform trust computation,\nbased on the trust metadata of nodes available to them,\nto evaluate the behavior of nodes before interacting with them.\nAdditionally, a central entity such as a Trust Agent (TA) could\nissue queries in the network, requesting for the trust metadata\nof nodes, to perform trust aggregation, and thereby evaluate the\nbehavior of all nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose\na scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an\ninformation network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET.\nThe simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and\nretrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes\nand mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management\nin a MANET.

The tool allows users to identify and correct inconsistencies that are otherwise hidden across multiple articles.

Different protocols (single-copy, multi-copy, erasure-coding-based etc.) utilizing store-carry-and-forward paradigm are proposed to achieve routing of messages in such environments by opportunistic message exchanges between nodes that are in the communication range of each other. The sparsity and distributed nature of these networks together with the lack of stable connectivity between source destination pairs make these networks vulnerable to malicious nodes which might attempt to learn the content of the messages being routed between the nodes. In this paper, we consider DTNs in which malicious nodes are present, to which we refer to as compromised DTNs. We discuss and analyze the effects of presence of malicious nodes in the compromised DTN on routing of messages.We propose a two period routing approach which aims to achieve desired delivery ratio by a given delivery deadline in presence of malicious nodes. Our results show that, with proper parameter setting, the desired delivery ratio by a given delivery deadline can be achieved most of the time by the proposed method."

        "abstract": "Despite recent efforts to characterize complex networks such as citation graphs or online social networks (OSNs), little attention has been given to developing tools that can be used to characterize directed graphs in the wild, where no pre-processed data is available. The presence of hidden incoming edges but observable outgoing edges poses a challenge to characterize large directed graphs through crawling. Unless we can crawl the entire graph or the directed graph edges are highly symmetrical, hidden incoming edges induce unknown biases in the sampled nodes. In this work we propose a random walk sampling algorithm that is less prone these biases. The driving principle behind our random walk is to construct, in real-time, an undirected graph from the directed graph in a way that is consistent with the sample path followed by the algorithm walking on either graph. We also study out-degree and in-degree distribution estimation. Out-degrees are visible to the walker while in-degrees are hidden (latent). This makes for strikingly different estimation accuracies of in- and outdegree distributions. We show that our algorithm can accurately estimate out-degree distributions and show that no algorithm can accurately estimate unbiased in-degree distributions unless the directed graph is highly symmetrical.

We explore features based on the nodes individual properties as well as based on the nodes location within the network. In addition, we take into account the nodes participation in other social networks within a specific prediction task. Different machine learning models built on the features are evaluated with the goal of finding a common set of features which are both robust and discriminating across the two datasets. Shortest Distance and Sum of Degree are found to be robust, discriminating features across the two datasets.

The advances in the realism of epidemic description call for the explicit modeling of individual behavioral responses to the presence of disease within modeling frameworks. Here we formulate and analyze a metapopulation model that incorporates several scenarios of self-initiated behavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals. We find that prevalence-based travel limitations do not alter the epidemic invasion threshold. Strikingly, we observe in both synthetic and data-driven numerical simulations that when travelers decide to avoid locations with high levels of prevalence, this self-initiated behavioral change may enhance disease spreading. Our results point out that the real-time availability of information on the disease and the ensuing behavioral changes in the population may produce a negative impact on disease containment and mitigation."

        "abstract": "The last decade saw the advent of increasingly realistic epidemic models that leverage on the availability of highly detailed census and human mobility data. Data-driven models aim at a granularity down to the level of households or single individuals. However, relatively little systematic work has been done to provide coupled behavior-disease models able to close the feedback loop between behavioral changes triggered in the population by an individual's perception of the disease spread and the actual disease spread itself. While models lacking this coupling can be extremely successful in mild epidemics, they obviously will be of limited use in situations where social disruption or behavioral alterations are induced in the population by knowledge of the disease. Here we propose a characterization of a set of prototypical mechanisms for self-initiated social distancing induced by local and non-local prevalence-based information available to individuals in the population. We characterize the effects of these mechanisms in the framework of a compartmental scheme that enlarges the basic SIR model by considering separate behavioral classes within the population. The transition of individuals in/out of behavioral classes is coupled with the spreading of the disease and provides a rich phase space with multiple epidemic peaks and tipping points. The class of models presented here can be used in the case of data-driven computational approaches to analyze scenarios of social adaptation and behavioral change."

These patterns however are often dominated by specific locations and recurrent flows and poorly modelled by the random diffusive dynamics generally used to study them. Here we develop a theoretical framework to analyse contagion within a network of locations where individuals recall their geographic origins. We find a phase transition between a regime in which the contagion affects a large fraction of the system and one in which only a small fraction is affected. This transition cannot be uncovered by continuous deterministic models because of the stochastic features of the contagion process and defines an invasion threshold that depends on mobility parameters, providing guidance for controlling contagion spread by constraining mobility processes. We recover the threshold behaviour by analysing diffusion processes mediated by real human commuting data."

Inspired by cascades of load shedding in coupled electric grids and other infrastructure, we study the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model on modular random graphs and on graphs based on actual, interdependent power grids.  Starting from two isolated networks, adding some connectivity between them is beneficial, for it suppresses the largest cascades in each system.\nToo much interconnectivity, however, becomes detrimental  for two reasons. First, interconnections open pathways for neighboring networks to inflict large cascades. Second, as in real infrastructure, new interconnections increase capacity and total possible load, which fuels even larger cascades. Using a multitype branching process and simulations we show these effects and estimate the optimal level of interconnectivity that balances their tradeoffs. Such equilibria could allow, for example, power grid owners to minimize the largest cascades in their grid.  We also show that asymmetric capacity among interdependent networks affects the optimal connectivity that each prefers and may lead to an arms race for greater capacity.  Our multitype branching process framework provides building blocks for better prediction of cascading processes on modular random graphs and on multi-type networks in general."

For instance, critical infrastructure includes assorted electric grids, telecom and computer networks, and transportation networks, and biological systems rely on the interplay of metabolic, gene regulatory, and protein interaction networks.  Here we develop an analytic model of two interacting networks using random graph methods and show that there exists a regime where the critical threshold for the emergence of system-wide large-scale connectivity is reduced.  This phenomena, which we call cooperative enhancement, can result when two networks are loosely-coupled or a single network is modular. Random graphs provide simple models for disease transmission and we show that for two loosely-coupled populations, a greater number of people could be infected with fewer overall transmissions. Other systems, such as communication networks, stand to benefit from cooperative enhancement achieving greater global connectivity with fewer total connections. "

        "abstract": "Here we present a range-limited approach to centrality measures in both non-weighted and weighted complex networks. We introduce an efficient method that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality based on shortest paths of lengths not longer than l = 1, . . . , L in case of non-weighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities based on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than wl = l, l = 1,2...,L = R/. Range-limited centrality measures provide a systematic description on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its network neighborhoods 1-step out, 2-steps out, etc. up to including the whole network. These measures are more informative than the traditional centrality measures (which are diameter based), as network transport typically happens on all length-scales, from immediate neighborhoods to across the whole network. Using these algorithms and analytical approximations, we show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws for large undi- rected networks, similar to a central-limit type theorem, acting on the level of paths. As traditional centrality measurements on large networks are costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to reliably and efficiently estimate centralities of nodes and edges for large ranges, including diameter- based ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the ranking top-list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities quickly freezes as function of the range L, and hence the diameter-range top-list can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we show how to efficiently estimate the typical largest distance (and hence a lower-bound to the diameter) for a network of N nodes, exploiting the afore-mentioned scaling behavior. We illustrate these observations on model networks and on a large social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs ( 5.5  106 nodes and  2.7  107 edges)."

        "abstract": "A central challenge in human computation is in understand- ing how to design task environments that effectively attract participants and coordinate the problem solving process. In this paper, we consider a common problem that requesters face on Amazon Mechanical Turk: how should a task be de- signed so as to induce good output from workers? In posting a task, a requester decides how to break down the task into unit tasks, how much to pay for each unit task, and how many workers to assign to a unit task. These design deci- sions affect the rate at which workers complete unit tasks, as well as the quality of the work that results. Using im- age labeling as an example task, we consider the problem of designing the task to maximize the number of quality tags received within given time and budget constraints. We con- sider two different measures of work quality, and construct models for predicting the rate and quality of work based on observations of output to various designs. Preliminary results show that simple models can accurately predict the quality of output per unit task, but are less accurate in pre- dicting the rate at which unit tasks complete. At a fixed rate of pay, our models generate different designs depending on the quality metric, and optimized designs obtain signifi- cantly more quality tags than baseline comparisons."

We introduce routing scoring rules that bring truthful contribution of information and optimal routing of the task into a Perfect Bayesian Equi- librium under common knowledge about the amount of in- formation available to each agent on the network. Relaxing the common knowledge assumption, we address the chal- lenge of routing in situations where states of information differ among agents. We introduce a family of local routing rules, which isolate routing decisions that depend only on local information in equilibrium, while still promoting effec- tive routing. Local routing rules are the only routing scoring rules that induce truthful equilibria in which agents routing decisions rely solely on local information. Simulation results show that local routing decisions can lead to effective task routing."

The features we investigate are based on an agents individual properties as well as those based on the agents location within the network. In addition, we analyze features which take into account the agents participation in other social interactions within the same network. Two datasets were used in our study - Sony Online Entertainments (SOE) Everquest II game dataset and IBMs SmallBlue sentiments dataset. The first dataset captures activities from a complex persistent game environment characterized by several types of in-game social interactions whereas the second dataset has anonymized information about peoples email and instant messaging communication. \nWe formulate the problem as one of link prediction, intranetwork and internetwork, in social networks. We first build machine learning models using the aforementioned features and then perform an ablation study to identify robust features of trust. Results indicate that shared skills and interests between two agents, their level of activity and level of expertise are the top three predictors of trust in a social network. Furthermore, if only network topology information were available, then an agents propensity to connect or communicate, the cosine similarity between two agents and shortest distance between them are found to be the top three predictors of trust. In our study, we have identified the generic characteristics of the networks used as well as the features investigated so that they can be used as guidelines for studying the problem of predicting trust formation in other social networks."

In developing this design, we reviewed several trust based\npapers including several randomly chosen from the NS CTA publications site in order to create an\napplication that may be used with a wide variety of trust algorithms.\nThe intent of this application is to create agents to simulate people communicating in an arbitrary\nnetwork. Trust considerations and manipulations play a key role in generating social communications and\npropagating information across a network. Trust is considered at all three NS CTA networks: social,\ninformation, and communications. Social trust is based on agents trusting each other, information trust is\nbased on agents trusting factoids in the network, communications trust is based on agents trusting an edge\nbetween itself and another agent (potentially several communication hops away).\nBecause trust is such a vague and dynamically changing notion, the goal of this design is to have a tool\nwhich can be used to test a broad range of trust metrics with minimal coding for the end user. Trust and\nmetric gathering is based on algorithms plugged into the application framework. The framework does not\ndepend on any particular algorithm and they may be swapped in and out depending on the scenario being\nrun. Algorithms will be able to utilize functions provided by the system so they are easy to implement and\nremove. The system will be able to support many algorithms simultaneously.\n\nAvailable at https://www.ns-cta.org/projects/netsci/browser/docs-team/trunk/irc/Projects/R3/Experimentation_TestBed/TrustInterfaceApplication-Design.pdf"

History-dependent graphical multiagent models (hGMMs) further capture dynamics by conditioning behavior on history.  We propose a greedy algorithm for learning hGMMs from time-series data, inducing both graphical structure and parameters. To evaluate this learning method, we employ human-subject experiment data for a dynamic consensus scenario, where agents on a network attempt to reach a unanimous vote. We empirically show that the learned hGMMs directly expressing joint behavior outperform alternatives in predicting dynamic voting behavior. Analysis of learned graphs reveals patterns of interdependence relations not directly reflected in the original experiment networks."

Existing models generally assume a given network structure, in practice derived from observations of agent communication or other interactions. In many realistic settings, however, observing all connections is not feasible. We consider the problem of modeling information diffusion when the network is only partially observed, and investigate two approaches. The first learns a graphical model with the given network structure, which compensates for missing edges by capturing induced correlations among node states. The second attempts to learn the missing connections directly. Using data generated from a cascade model with different network structures, we empirically demonstrate that both methods improve over assuming the given network is fully observed, as well as a previously proposed structure-learning technique. We further find that the graphical model outperforms structure learning when given sufficient data."

However this approach is limited by the exponential growth in game size relative to the number of agents. Player reductions allow us to construct games with a small number of players that approximate very large symmetric games. We introduce a new player reduction: deviation-preserving reduction, which generalizes and improves on existing methods by combining sensitivity to unilateral deviation with granular subsampling of the profile space. We evaluate our method on several classes of random games and show that deviation-preserving reduction performs better than prior methods at approximating full game equilibria, as measured by regret.

        "abstract": "With the proliferation of electronic modes of com- munication (e.g., e-mails, short messages), a group of people in an enterprise can form several distinct Communication Interaction Networks, or CINs for short. A CIN is essentially a graph representation of who talks to whom among a group of individuals. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of two modern enterprises and focus on three main questions: (Q1) how CINs from the two enterprises look, (Q2) how employees use the different available communication modes within an enterprise, and (Q3) how much information we can extract regarding the roles of their participants. We address these questions using em- pirical CINs from the Enron Corporation and a communication provider, using information from the exchange of e-mails, phone- calls, and short messages (SMS). For Q1, we reveal the following key structural properties that are shared by all the CINs in our study: they have high edge density, high clustering coefficient, and close to zero assortativity coefficient. For Q2, we observe that employees have differences in how they use the various communication modes. This suggests that different CINs capture different behavioral properties within an enterprise. For Q3, we propose HumanRank, a method of ranking individuals based on their importance (e.g., CEOs having higher rank than ordinary employees) using only the interactions between them. Next, using HumanRank, we introduce an unsupervised and parameter-free algorithm that identifies hierarchies by separating managers from ordinary employees. Our algorithm achieves above 70% accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art [1]."

What will change if nodes have partial, temporary or permanent immunity? The epidemic threshold is the minimum level of virulence to prevent a viral contagion from dying out quickly and determining it is a fundamental question in epidemiology and related areas. Most earlier work focuses either on special types of graphs or on specific epidemiological/cascade models. We are the first to show the G2-threshold (twice generalized) theorem, which nicely de-couples the effect of the topology and the virus model. Our result unifies and includes as special case older results and shows that the threshold depends on the first eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix, (a) for any graph and (b) for all propagation models in standard literature (more than 25, including H.I.V.) [20], [12]. Our discovery has broad implications for the vulnerability of real, complex networks, and numerous applications, including viral marketing, blog dynamics, influence propagation, easy answers to what-if questions, and simplified design and evaluation of immunization policies. We also demonstrate our result using extensive simulations on one of the biggest available social- contact graphs containing more than 31 million interactions among more than 1 million people representing the city of Portland, Oregon, USA."

Our contributions include a better understanding of performance metrics used in the game and a foundation of recommendation systems for mentors and apprentices. We examined three different game servers from the EverQuest II game logs. In all three servers, the results from our analyses suggest that increase in social diversity in terms of characters and classes encountered moderately negatively correlates with player performance. Based on this finding, we built predictive models to predict player's future performance based on past performance and social diversity in terms of mentoring activities. Our results indicate that 1) models employing past performance and social diversity perform better and 2) prediction for mentors is generally better than that for apprentices."

        "abstract": "Trust is an important aspect of mobile adhoc networks (MANETs). It enables entities to cope with\nuncertainty and uncontrollability caused by the free will of others. Trust computations and management\nare highly challenging issues in MANETs due to computational complexity constraints, and the\nindependent movement of component nodes. This prevents the direct application of techniques suited\nfor other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely\naffect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive\ninfluence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work\nwe present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs.\nWe highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches. In addition, we analyze various works\non trust dynamics including trust propagation, prediction and aggregation algorithms, the influence of\nnetwork dynamics on trust dynamics and the impact of trust on security services."

        "abstract": "Development of network of nodes connected with their trust values and the\npropagation of these trust values to far away nodes are basic operations of the modern\nday trustworthy networks. Trust can be exploited to mitigate the security threats in wireless\nnetwork. Most of the existing trust propagation methods are based on flooding trust\ninformation, which puts a heavy burden on wireless communication, especially in ad hoc\nnetwork and sensor network. In this paper, we propose a rendezvous based trust propagation\nscheme. Trust requester and trust provider send out trust-request and computed-trust tickets\nrespectively, which will meet in some common rendezvous node with certain probability.\nComputed-trust will then be propagated to the requester. We carry out detailed performance\nevaluations of our scheme. The results show that our method achieves up to 66% overhead\nreduction in trust propagation compared to flood based methods."

The node mobility brings\nchallenge to trust propagation, where traditional graph-based\npropagation methods are difficult to apply. In this paper, we\npropose a trust establishment and propagation scheme by exploiting\nnatural mobility of mobile ad hoc network nodes. We\nestimate the moving state of neighboring nodes, and select the\ngroup of nodes with higher movement diversity as the next hop.\nIn this way, we expedite trust propagation with the help of\nmobility instead of treating it as a hurdle. Two classes of mobility\nmodels are considered: random direction model and clusterbased\nmodel. Extensive experiments are conducted on trust\npropagation performance using our scheme. Results show that the\ndetection rate of highly untrustworthy node is improved by about\n400% in random direction mobility model and about 300% in\ncluster-based mobility model compared to static case. Further, we\nobserve that trust convergence time and communication overhead\nvaries dramatically in different mobility models. Based on these\nobservations, we discuss the usage of different mobility models\nand metrics in different trust applications in mobile ad hoc\nnetworks."

        "abstract": "Entities in an information communication network may use various types of collaborative networking for sharing information such as documents, sensing reports, datasets, etc. The derivation history (i.e., the provenance) of the information plays a very important role in such a networking environment. For example, provenance can be used for information trustworthiness assessment, copyright clearance, data reconciliation, and data replication. While substantial research efforts have focused on these usages of provenance, very limited work has focused on the security issues of the provenance, which is the prerequisite of any provenance-based information analysis systems. In this paper, we explore the security properties of provenance meta-data compared to other general user data in a distributed network environment. We introduce a chain-structure provenance scheme to provide security assurance for the provenance meta-data in three dimensions - confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our scheme outperforms the previously proposed onion-structure provenance security scheme in terms of the flexibility, protection capability as well as computational overhead."

We evaluate\nthe probability of routing success on dynamic network (1D and\n2D) lattices with links going up and down as per an arbitrary\nbinary-valued stationary random process (such as a Markov\nprocess), in a source-routing framework. We find percolation\nthresholds on the time deadline for high-probability of routing\nsuccess in terms of the first and second order moments of the\nlink state process and we also demonstrate percolation thresholds\non the parameters characterizing the link process for a fixed\ntime deadline for a 1D Markov network as an example. This\nwork happens to generalize results reported in two articles\nfrom the 80s that appeared in the Physical Review Letters\non directed percolation theory. We analyzed the performance\nof a stateless single-copy opportunistic forwarding algorithm on\na 2D probabilistic grid  it does not demonstrate a non-trivial\npercolation threshold in link-up probability as does a flooding\nbased approach. However, interestingly, when we add a time\ndimension, i.e., let the network evolve as per a potentially timecorrelated\nlink dynamics, the opportunistic store and forward\nrouting algorithm also exhibits a critical threshold behavior. In\nthis 2D grid network case (as in the 1D network case), the\nnormalized messaging latency (ratio of routing latency to path\nlength) exhibits a critical phase transition, where we evaluate the\ncritical latency to path-length ratio as a function of the moments\nof the link up-down process."

Consider the scenario where information is introduced into a network, advising recipients to take an action. If at a later time, the infor- mation is found to be inaccurate and the action is unnecessary, it becomes a concern to cease the information from spreading any further and stop people from taking the action. The spread of inaccurate information can lead to confusion and mistrust, and therefore it is important to be able to quickly impede or retract inaccurate information, if needed to at a later time. We investigate the idea of introducing counter messages into a network to interfere with an ongoing diffusion and stop the action that was prescribed by the previous messages. These counter messages are diffusive themselves and may spread through the network based on the recipients evaluation of the information. We present an empirical framework for modeling the spread of actionable information and information retraction. Using the framework, we perform preliminary experiments to investigate strategies for broadcasting the counter message, in particular, how to identify individuals that should receive the counter message directly from the information source. There is a trade off between a fast effective spread of actionable information and the ability to retract the information. Findings also suggest that alternate strategies will have to be explored to incorporate group structures and the distribution of trust in designing a useful abort mechanism."

The second model applies a content-based strategy to compute a finer-grained credibility score for individual tweets. Lastly, we discuss a third model which combines facets from both models in a hybrid method, using both averaging and filtering hybrid strategies. To evaluate our novel credibility models, we perform an evaluation on 5 topic specific data sets mined from the Twitter streaming API, with specific focus on a data set of 40K users who tweeted about the topic Libya. Results show that the hybrid approach outperfoms a benchmark in predictive accuracy over a set of manually collected credibility ratings on the Libya dataset."

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from analytic inconsistencies that are demonstrably at odds with reality. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns that are statistically indistinguishable from the mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. The model predicts an unsuspected scale- invariance in commuting patterns and offers an analytic platform that can absorb system-specific improvements. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of phenomena affected by transport, mobility or migration patterns."

We validate our analytical\n  framework via both simulations as well as real-world experiments on\n  two different wireless testbeds. Subsequently, we use the framework\n  in a forensic analyzer to analyze the cause of\n  packet losses and determine the likelihood of forwarding\n  misbehaviors.

        "abstract": "Link prediction, i.e., predicting links or interactions between objects in a network, is an important task in network analysis. Although the problem has attracted much attention recently, there are several challenges that have not been addressed so far. First, most existing studies focus only on link prediction in homogeneous networks, where all objects and links belong to the same type. However, in the real world, heterogeneous networks that consist of multi-typed objects and relationships are ubiquitous. Second, most current studies only concern the problem of whether a link will appear in the future but seldom pay attention to the problem of when it will happen. In this paper, we address both issues and study the problem of predicting when a certain relationship will happen in the scenario of heterogeneous networks. First, we extend the link prediction problem to the relationship prediction problem, by systematically dening\nboth the target relation and the topological features, using a meta path-based approach. Then, we directly model the distribution of relationship building time with the use of the extracted topological features. The experiments on citation relationship prediction between authors on the DBLP network demonstrate the eectiveness of our methodology."

Specifi_x000C_cally, we model the trustworthiness of a medical claim based on experiences shared by users in health forums and mailing lists. The proposed claim scores can be used to rank related claims on their relative trustworthiness. We further extend the notion of trustworthiness to a site (or equivalently, a database of claims from the site) and propose a scheme to rank sites based on aggregating the trust scores of claims from the site. Our experiments show that community knowledge can be exploited to help users distinguish reliable medical claims from unreliable ones. The proposed techniques can be applied to other domains where similar corpora are available."

Therefore, the problem of domain adaptation remains one of the most important natural language processing challenges. While many different domain adaptation frameworks have been proposed, they have ignored one natural resource  the prior knowledge on the new domain. In this paper, we propose a new adaptation framework called Prior knowledge Driven Adaptation (PDA), which takes advantage of the knowledge on the target domain to adapt the model. We empirically study the effects of incorporating prior knowledge in different ways. On the task of part-of-speech tagging, we show that prior knowledge results in 42% error reduction when adapting from news text to biomedical text. On the task of semantic role labeling, when adapting from one news domain to another news domain, prior knowledge gives 25% error reduction for instances of be verbs (unseen in training domain) and 9% error reduction over instances of all verbs."

Most adaptation algorithms proposed in the literature train a new model for the new domain using unlabeled data.\n\nHowever, it is time consuming to retrain big models or pipeline systems. Moreover, the domain of a new target sentence may not be known, and one may not have significant amount of unlabeled data for every new domain.\n\nTo pursue the goal of an Open Domain NLP (train once, test anywhere), we propose ADUT (ADaptation Using label-preserving Transformation), an approach that avoids the need for retraining and does not require knowledge of the new domain, or any data from it. Our approach applies simple label-preserving transformations to the target text so that the transformed text is more similar to the training domain; it then applies the existing model on the transformed sentences and combines the predictions to produce the desired prediction on the target text.\n\nWe instantiate ADUT for the case of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) and show that it compares favorably with approaches that retrain their model on the target domain. Specifically, this *on the fly* adaptation approach yields 13% error reduction for a single parse system when adapting from the news wire text to fiction.\n"

The occurrences of events on the same graph could be correlated, exhibiting either attraction or repulsion. Such structural correlations can reveal important relationships between different events. Unfortunately, correlation relationships on\ngraph structures are not well studied and cannot be captured by traditional measures.\n\nIn this work, we design a novel measure for assessing two-event structural correlations on graphs. Given the occurrences of two events, we choose uniformly a sample of reference nodesfrom the vicinity of all event nodes and employ the Kendalls _x001C_ rank correlation measure to compute the average concordance of event density changes. Significance can be easily assessed by _x001C_ s nice property of being asymptotically normal under the null hypothesis. In order to compute the measure in large scale networks, we develop a scalable framework using different sampling strategies. The complexity of these strategies is analyzed. Experiments on real graph datasets with both synthetic and real events demonstrate that the proposed framework is not only efficacious, but also efficient and scalable."

In this work, we analyze real-life collaborative networks to understand their common characteristics and how information is routed in these networks. Our study shows that the topology\nof collaborative networks not only exhibits scale-free properties in node degree distribution, but also have other organizational\nconstraints. Furthermore, the number of steps in which information gets routed in these networks follow a power-law distribution too. Based on these observations, we develop a network model that can generate synthetic collaborative networks subject to certain structure constraints.\n\nWe further design a routing model that emulates task-driven information routing conducted by human beings in a collaborative network. Together, these two models can be used to study the effectiveness of information routing in different topological settings of a target collaborative network - a problem that is important in practice yet difficult to solve without the method proposed in this work."

A node is called a skyline node with respect to some query node, if it is not dominated by any other node in the graph, except the query node.  Given a query node, the set of skyline nodes are more interesting; because any non-skyline node is farther from the query node\nand also it carries less number of query node labels, compared to some skyline node.

With the advent of complex information networks, new graph queries are emerging, including graph pattern matching and mining, similarity search, ranking and expert finding, graph aggregation and OLAP. These queries\nrequire both the topology and content information of the network data, and hence, different from classical graph algorithms such as\nshortest path, reachability and minimum cut, which depend only on the structure of the network.

        "abstract": "At CPSWeek 2011, the authors presented a demonstration of Apollo, a fact-finder for participatory sensing that ranks archived human-centric and sensor data by credibility. The current demonstration significantly extends our previous work by allowing Apollo to operate on live streaming data; in this case, live Twitter feeds. As the role of humans as sensors increases in emerging sensing applications, a principled approach becomes necessary to address the problem of ascertaining the veracity of sources and observations made by them. Participatory and social sensing applications may use potentially unreliable or unverified sources, such as a phone-based sensing application that grows virally in a large un-vetted population, a disaster-response application, where conflicting damage assessment reports may come from large numbers of different volunteers, or a military application, where friendly observers at a remote location may make hard-to-verify claims about local events. Apollo analyzes noisy data that increasingly plagues human-centric sensing to determine which items of information are more likely to be true."

        "abstract": "Social networks are not static but rather constantly evolve in time. One of the elements thought to drive the evolution of social network structure is homophily - the need for individuals to connect with others who are similar to them. In this paper, we study how the spread of a new opinion, idea, or behavior on such a homophily-driven social network is affected by the changing network\nstructure. In particular, using simulations, we study a variant of the Axelrod model on a network with a homophilic rewiring rule imposed. First, we find that the presence of homophilic rewiring within the network, in general, impedes the reaching of consensus in opinion, as the time to reach consensus diverges exponentially with network size N. We then investigate whether the introduction\nof committed individuals who are rigid in their opinion on a particular issue, can speed up the convergence to consensus on that issue. We demonstrate that as committed agents are added, beyond a critical value of the committed fraction, the consensus time growth becomes logarithmic in network size N. Furthermore, we show that slight changes in the interaction rule can produce\nstrikingly different results in the scaling behavior of Tc. However, the benefit gained by introducing committed agents is qualitatively preserved across all the interaction rules we consider. "

        "abstract": "Human behavior is profoundly affected by the influenceability of individuals and the social networks that link them together. In the sociological context, spread of ideas, ideologies and innovations is often studied to understand how individuals adopt new states in behavior, opinion, ideology or consumption through the influence of their neighbors. In this paper, we study the evolution of opinions and the dynamics of its spread. We use the binary agreement model starting from an initial state where all individuals adopt a given opinion B, except for a fraction p<1 of the total number of individuals who are committed to opinion A. In a generalization of this model, we consider also the initial state in which some of the individuals holding opinion B are also committed to it. Committed\nindividuals are defined as those who are immune to influence but they can influence others to alter their opinion through the usual prescribed rules for opinion change. The question that we specifically ask is: how does the consensus time vary with the size of the committed fraction? More generally, our work addresses the conditions under which an inflexible set of minority opinion holders can win over the rest of the population. We show that the prevailing majority opinion in a population can be rapidly reversed by a small fraction p of randomly distributed committed agents who are immune to influence. Specifically, we show that when the committed\nfraction grows beyond a critical value pc = 9.79%, there is a dramatic decrease in the time, Tc, taken for the entire population to adopt the committed opinion. Below this value, the consensus time is proportional to the exponential function of the network size, while above this value this time is proportional to the logarithm of the network size. This has enormous impact on stability/instability of the society opinions. We also discuss conditions under which the committed minority can rapidly reverse the influenceable majority even if the latter is supported by a small fraction of individuals committed to their opinion. The results are relevant in understanding and influencing the social perceptions of international missions operating in various countries and attitudes to the mission goals."

For this reason, discovering overlapping structures is necessary for realistic social analysis. In this paper, we present a fast algorithm1, called SLPA, for overlapping community detection in large-scale networks. SLPA spreads labels according to dynamic interaction rules. It can be applied to both unipartite and bipartite networks. It is also able to uncover overlapping nested hierarchy. The time complexity of SLPA scales linearly with the number of edges in the network. Experiments in both synthetic and real-world networks show that SLPA has an excellent performance in identifying both node and community level overlapping structures."

In this paper, we consider a wireless network where the application flows consist of video traffic. From a user-perspective, reducing the level of video distortion is critical. We ask the question: *Should the routing policies change if the end-to-end video distortion is to be minimized?* We observe that popular link-quality based routing metrics (such as ETX) can cause video flows to converge onto a few paths and thus, cause high video distortion. We therefore, begin with constructing an analytical framework to first, understand and second, assess the impact of the wireless network on video distortion. The framework allows us to formulate a routing policy for minimizing distortion, based on which we design a protocol for routing video traffic. We find via simulations that our protocol is efficient in reducing video distortion compared to traditional routing metrics; specifically, the distortion is decreased by 20% which can significantly improve user perceived video qualit"

        "abstract": "Nodes that are part of a multi-hop wireless network, typically deployed in mission critical settings are expected to perform specific functions. Establishing a notion of reliability of the nodes with respect to each function (referred to as functional reliability or FR) is essential for efficient operations and management of the network. This is typically assessed based on evidence collected by nodes with regards to other nodes in the network. However, such evidence is often affected by factors such as channel induced effects and interference. In multi-hop contexts, unreliable intermediary relays may also influence evidence. We design a framework for collaborative assessment of the FR of nodes, with respect to different types of functions; our framework accounts for the above factors that influence evidence collection. Each node (say Chloe) in the network derives the FR of other nodes (say Jack) based on two types of evidence: (1) direct evidence, based on her direct interactions with each such node and (2) indirect evidence, based on feedback received regarding Jack from others. Our framework is generic and is applicable in a variety of contexts. We also design a module, which drastically reduces the overhead incurred in the propagation of indirect evidence at the expense of slightly increased uncertainty in the assessed FR values. We implement our framework on an indoor/outdoor wireless testbed. We show that with our framework, each node is able to determine the FR for every other node in the network with high accuracy. Our indirect evidence propagation module, decreases the overhead by 37 % compared to a simple flooding based evidence propagation, while the accuracy of the FR computations is decreased only by 8 %. Finally, we examine the effect of different routing protocols on the accuracy of the assessed values."

        "abstract": "Vast amounts of information are generated, shared, and processed in tactical networks. In such systems, human cooperation is a crucial component for effective processing of information. However, often human behavior is mediated by social and organizational relationships, i.e. trust between team members and system level characteristics, such as network delays. The impact these different processes have on each other is not well understood. In this paper, we develop an agent based model for information sharing that incorporates trust into decision making. The nodes in our model are decision makers and are primarily responsible for the disambiguation of received information to obtain correct situational awareness as quickly as possible. Additionally, each node must share information with other nodes to enable the network to attain shared situational awareness. In our model, team members make trust evaluations for fellow team members that they cooperate with throughout a task. Most existing trust models concentrate on whether trust exists or not, and do not consider what the trust is for. In contrast, we consider a new model of trust that incorporates two components: trust for competence and trust for throughput. In time constrained environments, both types of trust are crucial to mission success. Furthermore, this model allows us to study the impact of communication delays on overall trust. We also show how these trust values can be converted to labels that control agents decision making behavior. To test out this proposed model, we use a command and control experiment platform called ELICIT (Experimental Laboratory for Investigating Collaboration, Information-sharing and Trust). We give initial experimental results that show how trust of nodes change in an ELICIT information sharing task for various settings of initial team trust, the biases of the nodes and possible communication channel disturbances."

Most such work augments features from textual content with features representing the users social ties and the tie strength. Social ties are crucial in un- derstanding the network the people are a part of. However, textual content is extremely useful in understanding topics discussed and the personality of the individual. We bring a new dimension to this type of analysis with methods to compute the type of ties individuals have and the strength of the ties in each dimension. We present a new genre of be- havioral features that are able to capture the function of a specific relationship without the help of textual features. Our novel features are based on the statistical properties of communication patterns between individuals such as reci- procity, assortativity, attention and latency. We introduce a new methodology for determining how such features can be compared to textual features, and show, using Twitter data, that our features can be used to capture contextual informa- tion present in textual features very accurately. Conversely, we also demonstrate how textual features can be used to determine social attributes related to an individual."

Each format has a different quality and uses a different number of bits. Delivering all data in the highest quality format can overload system resources. The goal is to make intelligent format selection and routing decisions to maximize time average information quality subject to network stability. Lyapunov optimization theory can be used to solve such problems by repeatedly minimizing the linear terms of a quadratic drift-plus-penalty expression. To reduce delays, a novel extension of this technique that preserves the quadratic nature of the drift minimization while maintaining a separable decision structure is proposed. Also, paths are restricted to 1 or 2 hops to avoid high queuing delay. The resulting algorithm can push average information quality arbitrarily close to optimum, with a trade-off in average delay. The algorithm compares favorably to the basic drift-plus-penalty scheme in terms of backlog and delay."

In two dimensions, the clusters at the threshold are compact with a fractal surface of fractal dimension $d_f=1.49\\\\pm0.02$. On the simple-cubic lattice, distinct jumps in the size of the largest cluster are observed. We proceed to analyze the tree-like version of the model, where only merging bonds are sampled, for dimension two to seven. The transition is again discontinuous in any considered dimension. Finally, the dependence of the cluster-size distribution at the threshold on the spatial dimension is also investigated."

        "abstract": "Backpressure scheduling and routing, in which packets are preferentially transmitted over links with high queue differentials, offers the promise of throughput-optimal operation for a wide range of communication networks. However, when the traffic load is low, due to the corresponding low queue occupancy, backpressure scheduling/routing experiences long delays. This is particularly of concern in intermittent encounter-based mobile networks which are already delay-limited due to the sparse and highly dynamic network connectivity. While state of the art mechanisms for such networks have proposed the use of redundant transmissions to improve delay, they do not work well when the traffic load is high. We propose in this paper a novel hybrid approach that we refer to as backpressure with adaptive redundancy (BWAR), which provides the best of both worlds. This approach is highly robust and distributed and does not require any prior knowledge of network load conditions. We eval- uate BWAR through both mathematical analysis and simulations based on a cell-partitioned model. We prove theoretically that BWAR does not perform worse than traditional backpressure in terms of the maximum throughput, while yielding a better delay bound. The simulations confirm that BWAR outperforms traditional backpressure at low load, while outperforming a state of the art encounter-routing scheme (Spray and Wait) at high load."

In this study, we investigate the problem of discovering object groups that travel together (i.e., traveling companions) from streaming trajectories. Such technique has broad applications in the areas of scientic study, transportation management and military surveillance. To discover traveling companions, the monitoring system should cluster the objects of each snapshot and intersect the clustering results to retrieve moving-together objects. Since both clustering and intersection steps involve high computational overhead, the key issue of companion discovery is to improve the efciency of algorithms. We propose the models of closed companion candidates and smart intersection to accelerate data processing. A data structure termed traveling buddy is designed to facilitate scalable and exible companion discovery from streaming trajectories. The traveling buddies are micro-groups of objects that are tightly bound together. By only storing the object relationships rather than their spatial coordinates, the buddies can be dynamically\nmaintained along trajectory stream with low cost. Based on traveling buddies, the system can discover companions without accessing the object details. The proposed methods are evaluated with extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets. The buddy-based method is an order of magnitude faster than baselines. It also achieves higher precision and recall in companion discovery."

CPS claims many promising applications, such as traffic observation, battlefield surveillance and sensor-network based monitoring. One important research topic in CPS is about the atypical event analysis, i.e., retrieving the events from large amount of data and analyzing them with spatial, temporal and other multi-dimensional information. Many traditional approaches are not feasible for such analysis since they cannot describe the complex atypical events. In this study, we propose a new model of atypical cluster to effectively represent such events and efficiently retrieve them from massive data. The micro-cluster is designed to summarize an individual event, and the macro cluster is used to integrate the information from multiple events. To facilitate scalable, flexible and online analysis, the concept of significant cluster is defined and a guided clustering algorithm is proposed to retrieve significant clusters in an efficient manner. We conduct experiments on real datasets with the size of more than 50 GB, the results show that the proposed method can provide more accurate information with only 15% to 20% time cost of the baselines."

In real world, tremendous amounts of data are distributed in a network. Existing features selection methods are not suited for networked data because the i.i.d. assumption no longer holds. This motivates us to study feature selection in a network. In this paper, we present a supervised feature selection method based on Laplacian Regularized Least Squares (LapRLS) for networked data. We use linear regression to utilize the content information, and adopt graph regularization to consider the link information. The proposed feature selection method aims at selecting a subset of features such that the empirical error of LapRLS is minimized. The resultant optimization problem is a mixed integer programming, which is difficult to solve. It is relaxed into a L2,1-norm constrained LapRLS problem and solved by accelerated\nproximal gradient descent algorithm. Experiments on benchmark networked data sets show that the proposed feature selection method outperforms traditional feature selection method and the state-of-the-art learning-in-network approaches."

There are two challenges in multi-label learning: (1) the labels are interdependent and correlated, and (2) the data are of high dimensionality. In this paper, we aim to tackle these challenges in one shot. In particular, we propose to learn the label correlation and do feature selection simultaneously. We introduce a matrix-variate Normal prior distribution on the weight vectors of the classifier to model the label correlation. Our\ngoal is to find a subset of features, based on which the label correlation regularized loss of label ranking is minimized. The resulting multi-label feature selection problem is a mixed integer programming, which is reformulated as quadratically constrained linear programming (QCLP). It can be solved by cutting plane algorithm, in each iteration of which a minimax optimization problem is solved by dual coordinate descent and projected sub-gradient descent alternatively. Experiments on benchmark data sets illustrate that the proposed methods outperform single-label feature selection method and many other state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods."

Two representative methods based on Fisher criterion are Fisher Score and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The former is developed for feature selection while the latter is designed for subspace learning. In the past decade, these two approaches are often studied independently. In this paper, based on the observation that Fisher score and LDA are complementary, we propose to integrate Fisher score and LDA in a unified framework, namely Linear Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LDDR). We aim at finding a subset of features, based on which the learnt linear transformation via LDA maximizes the Fisher criterion. LDDR inherits the advantages of Fisher score and LDA and is able to do\nfeature selection and subspace learning simultaneously. Both Fisher score and LDA can be seen as the special cases of the proposed method. The resultant optimization problem is a mixed integer programming, which is difficult to solve. It is relaxed into a L2;1-norm constrained least square problem and solved by accelerated proximal gradient descent algorithm. Experiments on benchmark face recognition data sets illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art methods arguably. "

A patent can be held for up to 20 years. However, large maintenance fees need to be paid to keep it enforceable. If the patent is deemed not valuable, the owner may decide to abandon it by stopping paying the maintenance fees to reduce the cost. For large companies or organizations, making such decisions is difficult because too many patents need to be investigated. In this paper, we\nintroduce the new patent mining problem of automatic patent maintenance prediction, and propose a systematic solution to analyze patents for recommending patent maintenance decision. We model the patents as a heterogeneous time-evolving information network and propose new patent features to build model for a ranked prediction on whether to maintain or abandon a patent. In addition, a network-based refinement approach is proposed to further improve the performance. We have conducted experiments on the large scale United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database which contains over four million granted patents.

Working together with this diffusion process is the evolution of topic content, where novel contents are introduced by documents which adopt the topic. Unlike explicit user behavior (e.g., buying a DVD), both the diffusion paths and the evolutionary process of a topic are implicit, making their discovery challenging. In this paper, we track the evolution of an arbitrary topic and reveal the latent diffusion paths of that topic in a social community. A novel and principled probabilistic model is proposed which casts our task as an joint inference problem, which considers textual documents, social influences, and topic evolution in a unified way. Specifically, a mixture model is introduced to model the generation of text according to the diffusion and the evolution of the topic, while the whole diffusion process is regularized with user-level social influences through a Gaussian Markov Random Field. Experiments on both synthetic data and real world data show that the discovery of topic diffusion and evolution benefits from this joint\ninference; and the probabilistic model we propose performs significantly better than existing methods."

        "abstract": "In practical data integration systems, it is common for the data sources being integrated to provide conflicting information about the same entity. Consequently, a major challenge for data integration is to derive the most complete and accurate integrated records from diverse and sometimes conflicting sources. We term this challenge the truth _x000C_finding problem -- deciding which information being merged is most likely to be true. We observe that some sources are generally more reliable than others, and therefore a good model of\nsource quality is key to solving the truth _x000C_nding problem. In this work, we propose a probabilistic graphical model that can infer the truth of records and quality of sources without any supervision. In contrast to previous methods, our principled approach leverages a generative process of two types of errors (false positive and false negative) by modeling two di_x000B_erent aspects of source quality. We develop an e_x000E_cient sampling-based inference algorithm that needs very few iterations in practice and enjoys linear time complexity, making our method scalable. Experiments on two real world datasets show that our new method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches to the truth _x000C_nding problem. "

Consider the following routing problem in the context of a large power law network $G$. A small number of nodes want to exchange messages over short paths on $G$. These nodes do not have access to the topology of $G$ but are allowed to crawl the network subject to a budget constraint. Only crawlers whose paths cross are allowed to exchange topological information. In this work we study the use of random walks (RWs) to crawl $G$. We show that RWs have the ability to find short paths and that this bears no relation to the paths that they take. Instead, it relies on two properties of RWs on power law networks:\nThe RW ability to observe a sizable fraction of the network edges;\nThe near certainty that two distinct RW sample paths cross after a small percentage of the nodes have been visited.\nWe show promising simulation results on several real world networks."

In this problem,\nthere are N arms (corresponding to channels) and one player\n(corresponding to a secondary user). The state of each arm\nevolves as a finite-state Markov chain with unknown parameters.\nAt each time slot, the player can select K < N arms to\nplay and receives state-dependent rewards (corresponding to the\nthroughput obtained given the activity of primary users). The\nobjective is to maximize the expected total rewards (i.e., total\nthroughput) obtained over multiple plays. The performance of\nan algorithm for such a multi-armed bandit problem is measured\nin terms of regret, defined as the difference in expected reward\ncompared to a model-aware genie who always plays the best K\narms. In this paper, we propose a new continuous exploration and\nexploitation (CEE) algorithm for this problem. When no information\nis available about the dynamics of the arms, CEE is the\nfirst algorithm to guarantee near-logarithmic regret uniformly\nover time. When some bounds corresponding to the stationary\nstate distributions and the state-dependent rewards are known,\nwe show that CEE can be easily modified to achieve logarithmic\nregret over time. In contrast, prior algorithms require additional\ninformation concerning bounds on the second eigenvalues of the\ntransition matrices in order to guarantee logarithmic regret.\nFinally, we show through numerical simulations that CEE is\nmore efficient than prior algorithms."

We show that the key parameter\naffecting the on-demand file download latency is the ratio of file\nsize to download bandwidth. When this ratio is small so that a file\ncan be communicated in a single encounter, we find that coding\ntechniques offer very little benefit over simple file replication.\nHowever, we analytically show that for large ratios, for a simple\nmemoryless contact model, distributed erasure coding yields a latency\nbenefit of $N/\\\\alpha$ over uncoded replication, where $N$ is the\nnumber of vehicles and $\\\\alpha$ the number of replicas of each stored\nfile. Effectively, in this regime, coding yields the same performance\nas replicating all the files at all other vehicles, but using much\nless storage. We also evaluate the benefits of coded storage using a\nlarge real vehicle trace from Beijing. These simulations, which\ninclude a realistic radio link quality model for a IEEE 802.11p\ndedicated short range communication (DSRC) radio, validate the\nobservations from the analysis, demonstrating that coded storage\ndramatically speeds up the download of large files in vehicular\nnetworks.\n"

        "abstract": "We study the process of an agent infiltrating a trust/reputation based network. At every time step, the agent solicits a connection\nrequest (friend request). The goal of the agent is to amass as many such connections as possible to further its goals. Our model for such an infiltration of a network relies on two properties of the actors in the network. They desire more links (an ego effect); they are more likely to connect to trusted or credible nodes (the trust by reference effect). Within this model, we consider random and greedy strategies for infiltration used by the agent to befriend a significant fraction of the network. We demonstrate that (i) The trust by reference effect is crucial to the success of the agent. If agents are not trusting enough, then the network is robust to infiltration. On the other hand if the actors are just a logarithmic factor more trusting the process cascades and a significant fraction of the network is infiltrated. Thus, there is a critical trust-by-reference threshold at which a phase transition occurs. (ii) The network structure is important. If the trust effect is small, then well clustered networks (typical social networks) are easier to infiltrate than diffuse networks (for example Erdos-Renyi random graphs) which are robust to infiltration. However, when the trust effect is large and once the agent gets a foothold it snowballs, then a graph with large expansion (for example Erdos-Renyi random graphs)\nare easier to infiltrate. (iii) The algorithm used by the agent plays a significant role in success of the infiltration. An agent with limited infection that makes random connection requests is much less successful than an agent with enough information on the network\nstructure so that (for example) a simple greedy approach to soliciting the most likely connections first can be used. However, with another strategy based on limited local information, the infiltrator is a great deal more successful than when utilizing a random strategy."

As a result, it presents tremendous potential for people to promulgate their own points of view; such efforts may be more subtle than typical vandalism. In this paper, we introduce new behavioral metrics to quantify the level of controversy associated with a particular user: a Controversy Score (C-Score) based on the amount of attention the user focuses on controversial pages, and a Clustered Controversy Score (CC-Score) that also takes into account topical clustering. We show that both these measures are useful for identifying people who try to push their points of view, by showing that they are good predictors of which editors get blocked. The metrics can be used to triage potential POV pushers. We apply this idea to a dataset of users who requested promotion to administrator status and easily identify some editors who significantly changed their behavior upon becoming administrators. At the same time, such behavior is not rampant. Those who are promoted to administrator status tend to have more stable behavior than comparable groups of prolific editors. This suggests that the Adminship process works well, and that the Wikipedia community is not overwhelmed by users who become administrators to promote their own points of view."

Most known\nalgorithms for the shortest path problem assume that the data is\nmain-memory resident.

The approach relies on the Locality Preserving Criterion, which preserves the locality of the data points. However, LPI\ntakes every word in a data corpus into account, even though many words may not be useful for document clustering. To overcome\nthis problem, we propose an approach called Locality Preserving Feature Learning (LPFL), which incorporates feature selection\ninto LPI. Specifically, we aim to find a subset of features, and learn a linear transformation to optimize the Locality Preserving Criterion based on these features. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed integer programming problem, which we relax into a constrained Frobenius norm minimization problem, and solve using a variation of Alternating Direction Method (ADM). ADM,\nwhich iteratively updates the linear transformation matrix, the residue matrix and the Lagrangian multiplier, is theoretically guaranteed\nto converge at the rate O( 1t ). Experiments on benchmark document datasets show that our proposed method outperforms LPI, as well as other state of the art document analysis approaches. "

        "abstract": "A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical (i.e., sensor) devices with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a situation-aware system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in real-world. It has wide application to scenarios of traffic control, environment monitoring and battleeld surveillance. This study investigates the specific problem of intruder mining in CPS: With a large number of sensors deployed in a designated area, the task is real time detection of intruders who enter the area, based on untrustworthy data. We propose a method called IntruMine to detect and verify the intruders. IntruMine constructs monitoring graphs to model the relationships between sensors and possible intruders, and computes the position and energy of each intruder with the link information from these monitoring graphs. Finally, a confidence rating is calculated for each potential detection, reducing false positives in the results. IntruMine is a generalized approach. Two classical methods of intruder detection can be seen as special cases of IntruMine under certain conditions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of IntruMine on both synthetic and real datasets and the experimental results show that IntruMine has better eectiveness and efficiency than existing methods."

        "abstract": "Objects linking with many other objects in an information network may imply various semantic relationships. Uncovering such knowledge is essential for role discovery, data cleaning, and better organization of information networks, especially when the semantically meaningful relationships are hidden or mingled with noisy links and attributes. In this paper we study a generic form of relationship along which objects can form a treelike structure, a pervasive structure in various domains. We formalize the problem of uncovering hierarchical relationships in a supervised setting. In general, local features of object attributes, their interaction patterns, as well as rules and constraints for knowledge propagation can be used to infer such relationships. Existing approaches, designed for  specic applications, either cannot handle dependency rules together with local features, or cannot leverage labeled data to dierentiate their importance. In this study, we propose a discriminative undirected graphical model. It integrates a wide range of features and rules by dening potential functions with simple forms. These functions are also summarized and categorized. Our experiments on three\nquite dierent domains demonstrate how to apply the method to encode domain knowledge. The ecacy is measured with both traditional and our newly designed metrics in the evaluation of discovered tree structures. "

We present a new approach to analyzing collaboration networks using simplicial complexes to represent the co-authorship relationships. We formally define several key novel metrics: 1) higher dimensional analogs of vertex degree (e.g., simplex and facet degrees), 2) homology, and 3) minimal non-faces; and discuss their interpretation as it relates to co-authorship. We use these metrics in a study of an Army Research Lab dataset that includes the publications of the Communications & Networks Collaborative Technology Alliance (C&N CTA). In particular, we show many properties of large networks are mirrored by this single-program publication dataset, the distinction of certain simplex degrees from vertex degrees, a power law characteristic in facet degrees, and some properties of topological *holes* and minimal non-faces."

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of truth discovery from noisy social sensing data. The work is motivated by the emergence of social sensing as a data collection paradigm of growing interest, where humans perform sensory data collection tasks. A challenge in social sensing applications lies in the noisy nature of data. Unlike the case with well-calibrated and well-tested infrastructure sensors, humans are less reliable, and the likelihood that participants' measurements are correct is often unknown a priori. Given a set of human participants of unknown trustworthiness together with their sensory measurements, this paper poses the question of whether one can use this information alone to determine, in an analytically founded manner, the probability that a given measurement is true. The paper focuses on binary measurements. While some previous work approached the answer in a heuristic manner, we offer the first optimal solution to the above truth discovery problem. Optimality, in the sense of maximum likelihood estimation, is attained by solving an expectation maximization problem that returns the best guess regarding the correctness of each measurement. The approach is shown to outperform the state of the art fact-finding heuristics, as well as simple baselines such as majority voting."

While critical in verifying the core ideas and evaluating its\npotential benefits, packet-trace studies ignore important aspects that can affect the correctness of the algorithms. Indeed, we first\nreveal conditions that cause a connection to never terminate. We show that a single packet loss, re-ordering or corruption can result in circular dependencies and cause DRE to loop endlessly. Second, with loss being a common characteristic of wireless networks, we evaluate the impact of DRE on latency, in the presence of packet losses: we found that DRE can increase the latency by a factor 6, an augmentation that users may not be willing to tolerate. Finally, we shared several insights, including interactions between transport layer protocols (e.g., TCP window congestion) and DRE that cause sophisticated encoding algorithms to perform poorly. We hope that the insights we discovered and present will help the design of efficient and robust DRE encoding algorithms."

The large amounts of data collected by the\nsensor nodes makes the problem of monitoring a  challenging one from\nmany technological stand points. Sensor nodes have limited local\nstorage, computational power, and battery life, as a result of which\nit is desirable to minimize the storage, processing and\ncommunication from these nodes. The problem is further magnified by\nthe fact that a given network may have hundreds or thousands of\nsensor nodes and therefore it is very expensive to localize all the\ndata at a given global node for analysis both from a storage and\ncommunication point of view. This has lead to the important problem\nof complexity management of sensor data streams. In real\napplications, sensor streams are often highly correlated with one\nanother or may have other kinds of functional dependencies. For\nexample, a group of sound sensors in a given geographical proximity\nmay pick almost the same set of signals. Similarly, there may be\nfunctional dependencies between sensors which pick different kinds\nof signals, since the external events may affect different kinds of\nsensors in characteristic ways. Clearly, since there are\nconsiderable functional dependencies between different sensors,\nthere are huge {\\\\em redundancies} in the data collected by sensors.\nThese redundancies may also change as the data evolves over time. In\nthis paper, we discuss real time algorithms for reducing the  volume\nof the data collected in sensor networks.  The broad idea is to\ndetermine the functional dependencies between sensor streams\nefficiently in real time, and actively collect the data  only from a\nminimal set of sensors.  The remaining sensors collect the data\npassively at low sampling rates in order to detect any changing\ntrends in the underlying data. We present real time algorithms in\norder to minimize the power consumption in reducing the data\ncollected and show that the resulting data retains almost the same\namount of information at a much lower cost."

Typically, a set of\nsources with varying reliability claim  observations about a set of\nobjects and the goal is to jointly discover the true fact for each\nobject and the trustworthy sources. In this paper, we propose a\nLatent Dirichlet Truth (LDT)  discovery model to approach this\nproblem. It defines a random field over all the possible\nconfigurations of the trustworthiness of sources and facts, and the\nmost probable configuration is inferred by a maximum a-posteriori\n(MAP) criterion over the observed claims. Specifically, the model is\nbuilt upon an object-fact hierarchy, where the claimed fact is\nnaturally associated with objects.  We assume the natural\nconstraint, that only one of a competing set of facts is true for a\ngiven object. Moreover,\n while most of the existing algorithms  focus only on modeling the trustworthy\nsources, we also explicitly model the behavior of untrustworthy\nsources. The trustworthiness of a source is modeled in terms of its\nrelationship to a framework which is based on random guessing of the\ntrue facts for each object. This makes the LDT model more capable of\ndiscriminating the trustworthy sources from the untrustworthy ones,\nand in turn improves the discovery of true facts. Experiments on\nreal data sets show competitive results compared with  existing\nalgorithms."

For example, rumors on certain topics can propagate rapidly leading to a large number of nodes reporting the same (incorrect) observations. In this paper, we describe an approach for assessing the likelihood that a piece of information is in fact a rumor, and for inferring the most likely source of the rumor in the social network, in the absence of data provenance information. We model the social network as a directed graph, where vertices represent individuals and directed edges represent information flow (e.g., who follows whom on Twitter). A number of monitor nodes are injected into the network whose job is to report data they receive. Our algorithm identifies rumors and their sources by observing which of the monitors received the given piece of information and which did not. While the problem has exponential complexity, we present a polynomial approximation and show that, with a sufficient number of monitor nodes, it is possible to recognize most rumors correctly and pinpoint their originators with high accuracy.

        "abstract": "This demonstration illustrates an information aggregation and summarization service for social sensing applications. Social sensing, using mobile phones and other networked devices in the possession of individuals, has gained significant popularity in recent years. In some cases, the information collected is structured, such as numeric data from temperature sensors, accelerometers, or GPS devices. Aggregate statistical properties, such as expected values, standard deviations, and outliers, can be easily computed, and can be used to summarize the data set. In other cases, however, the collection includes unstructured data types such as text or images with textual annotations. The concepts of expected values and outliers are harder to define, yet it is still important to be able to aggregate and summarize the data. We demonstrate a system which can automatically summarize real-time textual data common to social sensing applications. Specifically, we focus on text messages that describe events in the environment. The output of our service provides a reliable summary of observations that can be used in many contexts from military intelligence to participatory sensing campaigns."

        "abstract": "This demonstration illustrates a service for collection and delivery of images, in participatory camera networks, to maximize coverage while removing outliers (i.e., irrelevant images). Images, such as those taken by smart-phone users, represent an important and growing modality in social sensing applications. They can be used, for instance, to document occurrences of interest in participatory sensing campaigns, such as instances of graffiti on campus or invasive species in a park. In applications with a significant number of participants, the number of images collected may be very large. A key problem becomes one of data triage to reduce the number of images delivered to a manageable count, without missing important ones. In prior work, the authors presented a service, called PhotoNet, that reduces redundancy among delivered images by maximizing diversity. The current work significantly extends our previous effort by recognizing that diversity maximization often leads to selection of outliers; images that are visually different but not necessarily relevant, which in fact reduces the quality of the delivered image pool. We demonstrate a new prioritization technique that maximizes diversity among delivered pictures, while also reducing outliers.  "

Most taxicabs in large\ncities are equipped with sensing devices, which can sense\ncurrent location of the taxicab and upload the data to a\ncentral server for dispatch and control. Such location traces\nare a rich source of information and can be used for various\npurposes such as congestion pricing, taxicab placement, and\nimproved city planning. In order to draw such inferences,\nwe need to identify human (passenger) mobility patterns,\nthat is, when the taxicab is occupied and the pickup and\ndropoff points of a particular trip and differentiate it from\nother traffic-related behaviors such as slow moving traffic. In\nthis paper, we show that while past approaches (e.g., based\non clustering and classification) are effective in detecting\nhotspots using location traces, they are largely ineffective in\nidentifying trips (pairs of pickup and dropoff points). We\ntackle this problem by using the notion of a stretch factor\n(that is commonly used in compact routing) to identify\ntrip(s) made by a taxicab. We develop several algorithms for\nidentifying such trips and show that a HiddenMarkov Model\nbased algorithm can identify trips with a precision and recall\nof 90-94%  a significant improvement over past approaches\nthat result in a precision and recall of about 30-40%. We\ndemonstrate the accuracy of these algorithms on two real\ntaxicab datasets, obtained from deployments in Stockholm,\nSweden and Shanghai, China. We then identify human mobility\npatterns from the output of these algorithms."

        "abstract": "Obesity prevalence is increasing in many countries at alarming levels. A difficulty in the conception of policies to reverse these trends is the identification of the drivers behind the obesity epidemics. Here, we implement a spatial spreading analysis to investigate whether obesity shows spatial correlations, revealing the effect of collective and global factors acting above individual choices. We find a regularity in the spatial fluctuations of their prevalence revealed by a pattern of scale-free long-range correlations. The fluctuations are anomalous, deviating in a fundamental way from the weaker correlations found in the underlying population distribution indicating the presence of collective behavior, i.e., individual habits may have negligible influence in shaping the patterns of spreading. Interestingly, we find the same scale-free correlations in economic activities associated with food production. These results motivate future interventions to investigate the causality of this relation providing guidance for the implementation of preventive health policies."

        "abstract": "Social networks analysis includes examining the actions of entities in a social setting. These actions can be either interactions between entities (e.g. talking, exchanging items etc.), or actions which do not include interactions, but nevertheless are happening in a social\ncontext, hence are influenced by social relations. Such actions often contain behavioral patterns that are specific to the actions involved. It is important to understand such patterns to be able to model social environments reliably.\n\nIn this work, we introduce a novel method for modeling and classifying behavior of nodes in a social network using Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs). Informally, PCFGs are regular context free grammars consisting of START symbol, terminals, nonterminals and production rules), augmented with probabilities assigned to the production rules to denote how likely each rule is to be used when producing a sentence from this grammar. Given a set of action sequences, a PCFG can be automatically constructed [Geyik, 2009] to derive probabilities for these actions and concisely represent behavioral patterns based on the input data. This PCFG can either be used to predict or classify future behaviors, or to understand the relationships between these patterns via manual inspection possible thanks to conciseness of the PCFG representation."

In this article, we review the literature on the influence model, which utilizes independent time series to estimate how much the state of one actor affects the state of another actor in the system. We extend this model to incorporate dynamical parameters that allow us to infer how influence changes over time, and we provide three examples of how this model can be applied to simulated and real data. The results show that the model can recover known estimates of influence, it generates results that are consistent with other measures of social networks, and it allows us to uncover important shifts in the way states may be transmitted between actors at different points in time."

        "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic networks has a rich gamut of application domains, such as road networks, communication networks and water distribution networks. An anomalous event, such as a traffic accident, denial of service attack or a chemical spill, can cause a local shift from normal behavior in the network state that persists over an interval of time. Detecting such anomalous regions of network and time extent in large real-world networks is a challenging task. Existing anomaly detection techniques focus on either the time series associated with individual network edges or on global anomalies that affect the entire network. In order to detect anomalous regions, one needs to consider both the time and the affected network substructure jointly, which brings forth computational challenges due to the combinatorial nature of possible solutions. \nWe propose the problem of mining all Significant Anomalous Regions (SAR) in time-evolving networks that asks for the discovery of connected temporal subgraphs comprised of edges that significantly deviate from normal in a persistent manner. We propose an optimal Baseline algorithm for the problem and an efficient approximation, called SIGSPOT . Compared to Baseline, SIGSPOT is up to one order of magnitude faster in real data, while achieving less than 10% average relative error rate. In synthetic datasets it is more than 30 times faster than Baseline with 94% accuracy and solves efficiently large instances that are infeasible (more than 10 hours running time) for Baseline. We demonstrate the utility of SIGSPOT for inferring accidents on road networks and study its scalability when detecting anomalies in social, transportation and synthetic evolving networks, spanning up to 1GB."

The process is typically as a cascade. However, in practice it is di_x000E_cult to observe a cascade completely. While the importance of cascades is understood in various applications, much less is known on how to infer cascades based on partial observations. In this paper we study the cascade inference problem following the independent cascade model, and provide a full treatment from complexity to algorithms. (1) We propose the idea of consistent trees as the inferred structures for cascades; these trees connect source nodes and observed nodes with paths satisfying the constraints from the observed temporal information. (2) We introduce metrics to measure the likelihood of consistent trees as inferred cascades, as well as several optimization problems for _x000C_finding the consistent trees. (3) We show that the decision problems for consistent trees are in general NP-complete, and that the optimization problems are hard to approximate. (4) We provide approximation algorithms with performance guarantees on the quality of the inferred cascades, as well as heuristics. We experimentally\nverify the effi_x000E_ciency and e_x000B_ffectiveness of our inference algorithms, using real life and synthetic data."

        "abstract": "Public opinion is often affected by the presence of committed groups of individuals dedicated to competing points of view. Using a model of pairwise social influence, we study how the presence of such groups within social networks affects the outcome and the speed of evolution of the overall opinion on the network. Earlier work indicated that a single committed group within a dense social network can cause the entire network to quickly adopt the groups opinion (in times scaling logarithmically with the network size), so\nlong as the committed group constitutes more than about 10% of the population (with the findings being qualitatively similar for sparse networks as well). Here we study the more general case of opinion evolution when two groups committed to distinct, competing opinions A and B, and constituting fractions pA and pB of the total population respectively, are present in the network. We show for stylized social networks (including Erdos-Renyi random graphs and Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks) that the phase diagram of this system in parameter space (pA, pB) consists of two regions, one where two stable steady-states coexist, and the remaining where only a single stable steady-state exists. These two regions are separated by two fold-bifurcation (spinodal) lines which meet tangentially and terminate at a cusp (critical point). We provide further insights to the phase diagram and to the nature of the underlying phase transitions by investigating the model on infinite (mean-field limit), finite complete graphs and finite sparse networks. For the latter case, we also derive the scaling exponent associated with the exponential growth of switching times as a function of the distance from the critical point."

        "abstract": "Temporal communities result from a consistent partitioning of nodes across multiple snapshots of an evolving complex network that can help uncover how dense clusters in a network emerge, combine, split and decay with time. Current methods for finding communities in a single snapshot are not straightforwardly generalizable to finding temporal communities since the quality functions used for finding static communities have highly degenerate landscapes, and the eventual partition chosen among the many partitions of similar quality is highly sensitive to small changes in the network. To reliably detect temporal communities we need not only to find a good community partition in a given snapshot but also ensure that it bears some similarity to the partition(s) found in immediately preceding snapshots. We present a new measure of partition distance called *estrangement* motivated by the inertia of inter-node relationships which, when incorporated into the measurement of partition quality, facilitates the detection of meaningful temporal communities. Specifically, we propose the estrangement confinement method, which postulates that neighboring nodes in a community prefer to continue to share community affiliation as the network evolves. Constraining estrangement enables us to find meaningful temporal communities at various degrees of temporal smoothness in diverse real-world datasets. Specifically, we study the evolution of voting behavior of senators in the United States Congress, the evolution of proximity in human mobility datasets, and the detection of evolving communities in synthetic networks that are otherwise hard to find. Estrangement confinement thus provides a principled approach to uncovering temporal communities in evolving networks."

        "abstract": "An information collection problem in a wireless network with random events is considered. Wireless nodes report on each event using one of multiple reporting formats. Each format has a different quality and uses a different number of bits. Delivering all data in the highest quality format can overload system resources. The goal is to make intelligent format selection and routing decisions to maximize time-averaged information quality subject to network stability. Lyapunov optimization theory can be used to solve such a problem by repeatedly minimizing the linear terms of a quadratic drift-plus-penalty expression. To reduce delays, a novel extension of this technique that preserves the quadratic nature of the drift minimization while maintaining a separable decision structure is proposed. Also, paths are restricted to 1 or 2 hops to avoid high queuing delay. The resulting algorithm can push average information quality arbitrarily close to optimum, with a trade-off in average delay. The algorithm compares favorably to the basic drift-plus- penalty scheme in terms of backlog and delay."

        "abstract": "This paper considers peer-to-peer scheduling for a network with multiple wireless devices. A subset of the devices are mobile users that desire specific files. Each user may already have certain popular files in its cache. The remaining devices are access points that typically have access to a larger set of files. Users can download packets of their requested file from an access point or from a nearby user. Our prior work optimizes peer scheduling in a general setting, but the resulting delay can be large when applied to mobile networks. This paper focuses on the mobile case, and develops a new algorithm that reduces delay by opportunistically grabbing packets from current neighbors. However, it treats a simpler model where each user desires a single file with infinite length. An algorithm that provably optimizes throughput utility while incentivizing participation is developed for this case. The algorithm extends as a simple heuristic in more general cases with finite file sizes and random active and idle periods."

        "abstract": "It is now recognized that the performance of an individual in a group depends not only on her own skills but also on her relationship\nwith other members of the group. It may be possible to exploit such synergies by explicitly taking into account social network topology. We analyze team-formation in the context of a large organization that wants to form multiple teams composed of its members. Such organizations could range from intelligence services with many analysts to consulting companies with many consultants, all having different expertise. The organization must divide its members into teams, with each team having a specified list of interrelated tasks to complete, each of which is associated with a different reward. We characterize the skill level of a member for\na particular task type by her probability of successfully completing that task. Members who are connected to each other in the social network provide a positive externality: they can help each other out on related tasks, boosting success probabilities.\nWe propose a greedy approximation for the problem of allocating interrelated tasks to teams of members while taking social network structure into account. We demonstrate that the approximation is close to optimal on problems where the optimal allocation can be explicitly computed, and that it provides significant benefits over the optimal allocation that does not take the network structure into account in large networks. We also discuss the types of networks for which the social structure provides the greatest boost to overall performance."

        "abstract": "We analyze the phenomenon of collusion for the purpose of boosting the pagerank of a node in an interlinked environment. We investigate the optimal attack pattern for a group of nodes (attackers) attempting to improve the ranking of a specific node (the victim). We consider attacks where the attackers can only manipulate their own outgoing links. We show that the optimal attacks in this scenario are uncoordinated, i.e. the attackers link directly to the victim and no one else. nodes do not link to each other. We also discuss optimal attack patterns for a group that wants to hide itself by not pointing directly to the victim. In these disguised attacks, the attackers link to nodes l hops away from the victim. We show that an optimal disguised attack exists and how it can be computed. The optimal disguised attack also allows us to find optimal link farm configurations. A link farm can be considered a special case of our approach: the target page of the link farm is the victim and the other nodes in the link farm are the attackers for the purpose of improving the rank of the victim. The target page can however control its own outgoing links for the purpose of improving its own rank, which can be modeled as an optimal disguised attack of 1-hop on itself. Our results are unique in the literature as we show optimality not only in the pagerank score, but also in the rank based on the pagerank score. We further validate our results with experiments on a variety of random graph models."

Thus the goal of this chapter is to offer readers a pragmatic guidebook based on our \nexperiences applying a social network approach to studying groups.     \nA fundamental commitment to incorporate relational and structural explanations along \nwith individual and group level factors distinguishes the social network approach from other \nperspectives on analyzing groups (Contractor, Wasserman & Faust, 2006; Katz, Lazer, Arrow, \nand Contractor, 2004; Kilduff & Tsai, 2003; Monge & Contractor, 2003; Wellman, 1988). This \nemphasis on incorporating relational explanations implies that the social network approach \nexamines the group from a multilevel perspective by spanning the individual level (member \nattributes, such as expertise and satisfaction), the dyadic level (information retrieval, trust), and \nthe overall group level (group density, centralization). We begin this chapter with a brief \ndiscussion of important research questions that motivate the use of a social network approach to \nstudy critical group processes. Second, we share with you our experiences on collecting network \ndata from groups. The third section describes the sausage making process of manipulating, \nvisualizing and analyzing network data. We conclude this chapter by addressing the challenges \nand limitations of network research in its current state, as well as its future.  "

The ability to \npredict player churn can be a valuable resource to game \ndevelopers designing customer retention strategies. The results \nfrom our theory-driven model significantly outperform a \ndiffusion-based churn prediction model on the same dataset. We \ndescribe the synthesis between a theory-driven approach and a \ndata-driven approach to a problem and examine the trade-offs \ninvolved between the two approaches in terms of prediction \naccuracy, interpretability and model complexity. We observe that \neven though the theory-driven model is not as accurate as the \ndata-driven one, the theory-driven model itself can be more \ninterpretable to the domain experts and hence, more preferable \nover a complex data-driven model. We perform lift analysis of \nthe two models and find that if a marketing effort is restricted in \nthe number of customers it can contact, the theory-driven model \nwould offer much better return-on-investment by identifying \nmore customers among that restricted set who have the highest \nprobability of churn. Finally, we use a clustering technique to \npartition the dataset and then build an ensemble on the \npartitioned dataset for better performance. Experiment results \nshow that the ensemble performs notably better than the single \nclassifier in terms of its recall value, which is a highly desirable \nproperty in the churn prediction problem.

The\nframework introduces the definition of *symptotic scalability*, and a\nmetric called *change impact value* (CIV) for comparing the impact of\nunderlying system parameters on network scalability.  A key idea is to\ndivide analysis into generic and specific parts connected via a\n*signature* -- a set of governing parameters of a network scenario --\nsuch that analyzing a new network scenario reduces mainly to\nidentifying its signature.\n\nUsing this framework, we present approximate non asymptotic\n(symptotic) scalability expressions for line, mesh and clique\ntopologies using TDMA and 802.11 for unicast and broadcast traffic by\ndetermining the signature for each of the 12 combinations. We compare\nthe analysis with discrete-event simulations and show that the model\nprovides sufficiently accurate estimates of scalability.  Based on the\nsymptotic expressions, we study the change impact value of underlying\nparameters on network scalability. We show how impact analysis can be\nused to tune network features to meet a scaling requirement, and\ndetermine the regimes in which reducing routing overhead impacts\nperformance.

        "abstract": "A modern information network usually contains billions of nodes and edges. However, a user-interested portion of the network is often in much smaller scale, hidden in the global network, especially considering that the real world network is composed of multi-typed, intermingled objects and links.  Although it is obvious that mining hidden networks from an original, gigantic, heterogeneous information network should be a pre-requisite for effective network mining, very few has seriously studied this critical problem. In this study, we examine the hidden network discovery problem, i.e., mining a sub-network containing multi-typed nodes and links, closely related to a user-specified query, from a large, global heterogeneous information network. Conceptually, a query is defined as a constraint on the attributes of one or more types of objects. Given a query, we first find a set of objects whose attributes exactly satisfy the constraint, and then learn the relevance of other objects to the query through information propagation in the multi-typed link structure.  This process is performed iteratively until the relevance of all the objects to the query is calculated. Finally, multi-typed objects and links that are the most relevant to the query could be returned to the user.  Extensive experiments show that our proposed method successfully captures the semantic meaning behind the query, and discovers hidden networks that the user is really interested in."

        "abstract": "Recently expertise retrieval has received increasing interests in both academia and industry. Finding experts with demonstrated expertise for a given query is a nontrivial task especially from a large-scale Web 2.0 systems, such as question answering and bibliography data, where users are actively publishing useful content online, interacting with each other, and forming social networks in various ways, leading to heterogeneous networks in addition to the large amounts of textual content information. Many approaches have been proposed and shown to be useful for expertise ranking. However, most of these methods only consider the textual documents while ignoring heterogeneous network structures or can merely integrate with one additional kind of information. None of them can fully exploit the characteristics of heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a joint regularization framework to enhance expertise retrieval by modeling heterogeneous networks as regularization constraints on top of document-centric model. We argue that multi-typed linking edges reveal valuable information which should be treated differently. Motivated by this intuition, we formulate three hypotheses to capture unique characteristics for different graphs, and mathematically model those hypotheses jointly with the document and other information. To illustrate our methodology, we apply the framework to expert finding applications using a bibliography dataset with 1.1 million papers and 0.7 million authors. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve significantly better results than the baseline and other enhanced models."

Most past research efforts on data\ndissemination examined syntactic redundancy between data items\n(e.g., common bit strings, entropy coding and compression, etc.),\nbut only limited work has examined the problem of reducing\nsemantic redundancy with the goal of providing higher quality\ninformation to end users. In this paper we propose to measure\nsemantic redundancy in large volume text streams using online\ntopic models and opinion analysis (e.g., topic = Location\nX and opinion = possible_hazard+, safe_zone). By\nsuppressing semantically redundant content one can better utilize\nbottleneck resources such as bandwidth on a resource constrained\nnetwork or attention time of a human user. However, unlike\nsyntactic redundancy (e.g., lossless compression, lossy compression\nwith small reconstruction errors), a semantic redundancy\nbased approach is faced with the challenge of having to deal\nwith larger inaccuracies (e.g., false positive and false negative\nprobabilities in an opinion classifier). This paper seeks to quantify\nthe effectiveness of a semantic redundancy based approach (over\nits syntactic counterparts) as a function of such inaccuracies\nand present a detailed experimental evaluation using realistic\ninformation flows collected from an enterprise network with\nabout 1500 users."

Most of the current data forwarding schemes choose the nodes with the best cumulative\ncapability of contacting others as relays to carry and forward data, but these nodes may not be the best relay choices within a short time\nperiod due to the heterogeneity of transient node contact characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the\nperformance of data forwarding with a short time constraint in DTNs by exploiting the transient social contact patterns. These patterns\nrepresent the transient characteristics of contact distribution, network connectivity and social community structure in DTNs, and we\nprovide analytical formulations on these patterns based on experimental studies of realistic DTN traces. We then propose appropriate\nforwarding metrics based on these patterns to improve the effectiveness of data forwarding.

        "abstract": "In social swarming applications, participants equipped with 3G and WiFi-capable smartphones are tasked to provide reports (possibly voluminous ones that include full-motion video) about their immediate environment to a central coordinator. In this paper, we consider the problem of timely delivery of these reports: each report has an associated deadline and the goal of the system is to retrieve as many reports as possible (or retrieve the most valuable reports), while satisfying each reports deadline. Reporters can use their cellular interface to upload their reports, but can also ask neighbors (using their faster WiFi interface) to help upload parts of their reports. Under an assumption that WiFi transmission delays are negligible, we first show that there exists a polynomial time optimal solution using an earliest- deadline-first (EDF) strategy for achieving the goals described above. In practice, WiFi delays are not negligible: in this case, it turns out that the scheduling problem is strongly NP-hard. We formulate two heuristic algorithms, and show, through simulations with real-world measurements, that these heuristics perform 2-4 better than without peer-assistance, and within 60% of an upper-bound on the optimal."

A number of co-occurrence similarity functions\nhave been proposed based on graph-theoretic, geometric, and statistical abstractions. Despite the variety of\nexisting algorithms, however, there exists no formal methodology for analyzing their properties and comparing\ntheir benefits and limitations. At the same time, the wide range of applications and domains where\nco-occurrence-based similarity functions are deployed limits the conclusiveness of experimental evaluations\nbeyond the narrow task typically considered by each method.\nThis paper proposes an axiomatic approach to analyzing co-occurrence similarity functions. The approach\nis based on formulating general, domain-independent constraints that well-behaved methods must satisfy\nto avoid producing degenerate results. Such constraints are derived based on the impact that continuous\naggregation of the co-occurrence data is expected to have on absolute or relative similarity estimates. Proposed\nconstraint-based analysis is applied to several representative, popular similarity functions and reveals\nthat, surprisingly, none of them satisfy all constraints unconditionally. The analysis leads to the design of\na theoretically well-justified similarity function called Random Walk with Sink (RWS). RWS is parameterized\nto satisfy the constraints unconditionally, with the parameterization having interesting probabilistic and\ngraph-theoretic interpretations."

        "abstract": "The ubiquity of smartphones and their on-board sensing capabili- ties motivates crowd-sensing, a capability that harnesses the power of crowds to collect sensor data from a large number of mobile phone users. Unlike previous work on wireless sensing, crowd- sensing poses several novel requirements: support for humans-in- the-loop to trigger sensing actions or review results, the need for incentives, as well as privacy and security. Beyond existing crowd- sourcing systems, crowd-sensing exploits sensing and processing capabilities of mobile devices. In this paper, we design and imple- ment Medusa, a novel programming framework for crowd-sensing that satisfies these requirements. Medusa provides high-level ab- stractions for specifying the steps required to complete a crowd- sensing task, and employs a distributed runtime system that coordi- nates the execution of these tasks between smartphones and a clus- ter on the cloud. We have implemented ten crowd-sensing tasks on a prototype of Medusa. We find that Medusa task descriptions are two orders of magnitude smaller than standalone systems required to implement those crowd-sensing tasks, and the runtime has low overhead and is robust to dynamics and resource attacks."

CPS claims many promising applications, such as traffic observation, battlefield surveillance, and sensor-network-based monitoring. One important topic in CPS research is about the atypical event analysis, i.e., retrieving the events from massive sensor data and analyzing them with spatial, temporal and other multi-dimensional information. Many traditional methods are not feasible for such analysis since they cannot describe the complex atypical events. In this study, we propose a novel model of atypical cluster to effectively represent such events and efficiently retrieve them from massive data. The basic-cluster is designed to summarize an individual event, and the macro-cluster\nis used to integrate the information from multiple events. To facilitate scalable, flexible and online analysis, the atypical cube is constructed and a guided clustering algorithm is proposed to retrieve significant clusters in an efficient manner. We conduct\nexperiments on real sensor datasets with the size of more than 50 GB, the results show that the proposed method can provide\nmore accurate information with only 15% to 20% time cost of the baselines."

These models aim at providing a rationale for understanding the emerging tipping points and nonlinear properties that often underpin the most interesting characteristics of socio-technical systems.

In this paper, we study how to eciently process a keyword query whose substitutes are dened by a given taxonomy. This problem is challenging because each term in a query can have a large number of substitutes, and the original query can be rewritten into any of their combinations. We propose to build an additional index (besides inverted index) to eciently process queries.  For a query workload, we formulate an optimization problem which chooses the additional index structure, aiming at minimizing the query evaluation cost, under given index space constraints. We show the NP-hardness of the problem, and propose a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm using dynamic programming, as well as an 1/4 (11/e)-approximation algorithm to solve the problem. Experimental results show that, with only 10% additional index space, our approach can greatly reduce the query evaluation cost."

        "abstract": "Searching and mining large graphs today is critical to a variety of application domains, ranging from community detection in social networks, to de novo genome sequence assembly. Scalable processing of large graphs requires careful partitioning and distribution of graphs across clusters. In this paper, we investigate the problem of managing large-scale graphs in clusters and study access characteristics of local graph queries such as breadth-first search, random walk, and SPARQL queries, which are popular in real applications.\nThese queries exhibit strong access locality, and therefore require specific data partitioning strategies. In this work, we propose a Self Evolving Distributed Graph Management Environment (Sedge), to minimize inter-machine communication during graph query processing in multiple machines.  In order to improve query response time and throughput, Sedge introduces a two-level partition management archi-\ntecture with complimentary primary partitions and dynamic secondary partitions. These two kinds of partitions are able to adapt in real time to changes in query workload. Sedge also includes a set of workload analyzing algorithms whose time complexity is linear or sublinear to graph size. Empirical results show that it significantly improves distributed graph processing on today's commodity clusters.\n\nSource Code: http://grafia.cs.ucsb.edu/sedge"

This paper extends subgraph querying by\nleveraging ontology information. (1) We introduce the ontologybased subgraph querying, which extends subgraph isomorphism by\nmapping query nodes to semantically related data nodes in terms of a given ontology graph. (2) We introduce a metric to measure the\ncloseness of the matches, as well as an optimization problem to find top K closest matches. (3)We provide a framework to evaluate subgraph queries using a filtering (using an ontology index) and verification (over a query view) strategy, where the ontology index and\nquery views are abstract representations of the data graph in terms of the ontology graph. We show that the framework evaluates subgraph\nqueries without traversing the data graphs. In addition, the ontology index can be efficiently updated upon data graph changes.

This paper provides an upper bound for the MSE of a stationary RW as a function of the MSE of RE and the absolute value of the second most dominant eigenvalue of the RW transition probability matrix.

Furthermore, such\ninteractions are quite fluid and evolving, as a result of which the\ntopology of the underlying network may change rapidly, as new\ninteractions form and others terminate.    In such cases,  it may be\ndesirable to determine the influential nodes based on the dynamic\ninteraction patterns. Alternatively, one may wish to discover  the\nmost likely starting points for a {\\\\em given infection pattern}. We\nwill propose methods which can be used  both for optimization of\ninformation spread, as well as the backward tracing of the source of\ninfluence spread. We will present experimental results illustrating\nthe effectiveness of our approach on a number of real data sets."

        "abstract": "Network modeling plays a critical role in identifying statistical regularities and structural principles common to many systems. The large majority of recent modeling approaches are connectivity driven, in the sense that the structural pattern of the network is at the basis of the mechanisms ruling the network formation. Connectivity driven models necessarily provide a time-aggregated representation that may fail to describe the instantaneous and fluctuating dynamics of many networks. We address this challenge by defining the activity potential, a time invariant function characterizing the agents' interactions in real-world networks and constructing an activity driven model capable of encoding the instantaneous time description of the network dynamics. The model provides an explanation of structural features such as the presence of hubs, which simply originate from the heterogeneous activity of agents. Additionally, we find that diffusive processes in highly dynamical networks can be described analytically in terms of the activity potential, allowing a quantitative discussion of the biases induced by the time-aggregated network representation in the analysis of dynamical processes in evolving networks."

Personality is one factor that dictates peoples propensity to trust and their relationships with others. In previous work, we have shown that personality can be predicted relatively accurately by analyzing social media profiles. We demonstrated this using public data from facebook profiles and text from Twitter streams. Understanding ones social circle could be a very useful indicator of her personality. However, most users of social media sites have typically large number of friends and followers. As a result, social signals provided by such sites tend to be very noisy. To overcome this problem, we develop a set of measures based on ones behavior towards her friends and followers. We introduce a number of measures that are based on the intensity and number of interactions one has with friends along a number of dimensions such as reciprocity and priority. We analyze these features along with a set of features based on the textual analysis of the messages sent by the users. We show that behavioral features are very useful in determining personality and perform as well as textual features."

Our proposed composite trust captures the impact of a multi-genre network that such tasks are carried on (i.e., cognitive/social and communication networks). Our trust model and simulations enable us to study the impact of team composition (i.e., composition and characteristics of individuals) and network connectivity (i.e., ability to communicate with neighboring nodes) on overall performance in terms of shared situation awareness (SA) and efficiency of communication. Our results show that trust-based information filtering and sharing strategy effectively guides entities to efficiently achieve high SA."

In contrast to prior approaches to disruption-tolerant networking that focus on physical aspects of connectivity over time, our approach is based on exploiting the social plane to improve the efficiency with which the physical network infrastructure is used to deliver information. We integrate the use of social-group information with an approach to routing that eliminates the use of destination-based routing tables. We show that our approach provides correct unicast routing, and compare its performance against that of epidemic routing and AODV operating over networks subject to connectivity disruption. The results from our simulated experiments illustrate that using the social plane to guide how information dissemination occurs in a wireless network offers substantial performance improvements over traditional methods for routing in disruption-tolerant networks."

        "abstract": "Credit networks are an abstraction for modeling trust between agents in a network. Agents who do not directly trust each other can transact through exchange of IOUs (obligations) along a chain of trust in the network. Credit networks are robust to intrusion, can enable transactions between strangers in exchange economies, and have the liquidity to support a high rate of transactions. We study the formation of such networks when agents strategically decide how much credit to extend each other. When each agent trusts a fixed set of other agents, and transacts directly only with those it trusts, the formation game is a potential game and all Nash equilibria are social optima. Moreover, the Nash equilibria of this game are equivalent in a very strong sense: the sequences of transactions that can be supported  from each equilibrium credit network are identical. When we allow transactions over longer paths, the game may not admit a Nash equilibrium, and even when it does,  the price of anarchy may be unbounded. Hence, we study two special cases. First, when agents have a shared belief about the trustworthiness of each agent, the networks formed in equilibrium have a star-like structure. Though the price of anarchy is unbounded, myopic best response quickly converges to a social optimum. Similar star-like structures are found in equilibria of heuristic strategies found via simulation. In addition, we simulate a second case where agents may have varying information about each others trustworthiness based on their distance in a social network. Empirical game analysis of these scenarios suggests that star structures arise only when defaults are relatively rare, and otherwise, credit tends to be issued over short social distances conforming to the locality of information."

The interaction technique draws on ideas from 3D\nmodeling, mesh deformation, and static graph drawing to promote\ndiscovery of hidden information across a wide variety of graph\ntypes and analysis tasks. The key innovation of this work is the\napplication of methods traditionally reserved for automated graph\nlayout and clustering, to produce useful task-specific layout through\ndynamic interactions. Graph nodes are dynamically repositioned\nusing an interpolated decay function over a single node movement\nprovided by a user. We describe several variants of the interpolation\nmethod, including coupling it with a fast local-cut algorithm\nfor cluster selection. Compared to traditional layout mechanisms\nthe technique is particularly useful when meta-data nodes are added\nto a graph, increasing its connectivity. We show how the techniques\ncan be used interactively to solve analysis tasks based on graph connectivity\nalone, and illustrate further benefits when coupled with\ncontent-based analysis and text-based search. Validation of both\napproaches is shown through use cases that highlight unique analytical\nbenefits of each technique on a variety of tasks.

But, these prominence values are linked to each other and evolve together. In particular, for an author to make an impact in the scientific community, she has to interact with a diverse set of individuals. The results of this is that her research will be known by a large number of communities. However, the research communities and topics have to be aligned along her research interests as well. Peer reviewers have to know and understand the research field and the results must be disseminated to the larger community through sustained interest in the given research field. Hence, the prominence of individuals and their artifacts evolve simultaneously. In this paper, we develop novel methods to study both types of evolution processes and show their effectiveness using the DBLP dataset."

Scalable and robust estimation of source reliability is a key challenge in social sensing where humans or human-operated sensors act as data sources. In order to assess correctness of data, the reliability of sources must first be assessed, yet this is complicated when sources are not a priori known and vetted, but rather can opt in at will, for example, by downloading a sensing application on their mobile device. In our previous work, we developed a maximum likelihood source reliability estimator and approximately quantified confidence in its estimation based on an asymptotic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). In this paper we show that the asymptotic bound fails to track estimation performance when the number of sources is small. We derive the real CRLB to accurately characterize estimation performance for scenarios where the asymptotic bound fails. We study the limitations of the real and asymptotic CRLBs and show the trade-offs they offer between computational complexity and estimation scalability. We also evaluate the robustness of these bounds to changes in the number of sources. The results offer an understanding of attainable estimation accuracy of source reliability in social sensing applications that rely on un-vetted sources whose reliability is not known in advance.\n"

The at approach exploits information such as the lexical context and shallow dependency features.

In this paper, we propose two novel approaches to jointly and consistently extract names from parallel corpora.\nThe first approach uses standard linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as the learning framework, and incorporates\ncross-lingual features propagated between two languages. In the second approach, we proposed a joint CRFs model,\nwhich jointly decodes sentence pairs by incorporating bilingual factors based on word alignment.\nExperiments on Chinese-English parallel corpora demonstrated that the proposed methods significantly outperformed monolingual name taggers and achieved state-of-the-art performance. We also show that the proposed approaches are robust to automatic alignment noise and effective with even very small amount of training data. With only 20% of the training data, our proposed methods can already achieve better performance compared to the baseline learned from the whole training set."

        "abstract": "We introduce the concept of a vertex collocation profile (VCP) for the purpose of topological link analysis and pre- diction. VCPs provide nearly complete information about the surrounding local structure of embedded vertex pairs. The VCP approach offers a new tool for domain experts to understand the underlying growth mechanisms in their networks and to analyze link formation mechanisms in the appropriate sociological, biological, physical, or other con- texts. The same resolution that gives VCP its analytical power also enables it to perform well when used in super- vised models to discriminate potential new links. We first develop the theory, mathematics, and algorithms underlying VCP. Then we demonstrate VCP methods performing link prediction competitively with unsupervised and supervised methods across several different network families. We conclude with timing results that introduce the comparative performance of several existing algorithms and the practicability of VCP computations on large networks."

        "abstract": "Community detection or cluster detection in networks is often at the core of mining network data. Whereas the problem is well-studied, given the scale and complexity of modern day social networks, detecting ``reasonable'' communities is often a hard problem. Since the first use of k-means algorithm in 1960s, many community detection algorithms have been presented - most of which are developed with specific goals in mind and the idea of detecting meaningful communities varies widely from one algorithm to another. As the number of clustering algorithms grow, so does the number of metrics on how to measure them. Algorithms are often reduced to optimizing the value of an objective function such as modularity and internal density. Some of these algorithms rely on ground-truth, some do not. In this paper we study these algorithms and aim to find whether these optimization based methods are consistent with the real performance of community detection algorithm. Seven representative algorithms are compared under various performance metrics, and on various real world social networks."

        "abstract": "The essence of our paper is about understanding human information foraging patterns under competition and threat. Empirical research in both human and nonhuman animals reveals that many times foraging choices are context dependent and affected by the information foraging choices of others. Yet, broad empirical facts on the link between foraging patterns, competition and context-dependent information are only emerging due to the complication of gathering field data or constructing experiments. Drawing on field research and rich quantifiable information foraging data, we studied the human foraging choices of a cohort of 30 day traders over a period of two years from 2007-2008.  Our findings indicate that traders that maximize payoffs (making the right decisions) appear to follow a simple information foraging pattern under threat characterized by a surprisingly low frequency of exploitation of information. This finding is quantified is a generically applicable measure called short-term exploitative capacity that captures the difference between a forager's intake of information and his rivals expected intake over a relevant reference period of time.

        "abstract": "Scientific collaboration often brings together scientists from diverse disciplines to create a common understanding of problems whose solutions go beyond the scope of a single area of research. Not surprisingly, collaboration across disciplines has become an engine for innovation and the focus of substantial research in science and science policy. Traditionally, scientific collaboration has been studied as multiple author-to-author interactions (one-mode network) or multiple author-paper/project relations (two-mode network). However, an author-to-author interaction framework overlooks the influence that the characteristics of the project may have on the assembly of the scientific team.  Second, an author-to-paper interaction framework overlooks the relations that exist between authors. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hypergraph approach to the study the assembly and success of scientific research teams. A hypergraph approach allows for an integration of these types of relationships and represents a novel way to model scientific team assembly on the basis of exogenous ties among individuals, their characteristics, and the characteristics of their projects.  Hyperedges that link all members of an authorship team are especially effective in representing overlapping teams, which are typical within networks of scientific collaborators. We use hypergraphs as an alternative approach to examine a data set composed of 147 researchers who competed in a 2009 grant competition funded by the National Institute of Health. Our goal is to examine the collaboration relationships of scientific teams and network antecedents of team success. "

The Random Waypoint (RWP) [19] and Erdos-Renyi (ER) models have been a popular choice among researchers for generating mobility traces of nodes and relationships between them. Not only RWP and ER are useful in evaluating networking protocols in a simulation environment, but they are also used for theoretical analysis of such dynamic networks. However, it has been observed that neither relationships among people nor their movements are random. Instead, human movements frequently contain repeated patterns and friendship is bounded by distance. We used social networking site Gowalla to collect, create and validate models of human mobility and relationships for analysis and evaluations of applications in opportunistic networks such as sensor networks and transportation models in civil engineering. In doing so, we hope to provide more human-like movements and social relationship models to researchers to study problems in complex and mobile networks."

        "abstract": "This paper develops algorithms for improved source selection in social sensing applications that exploit social networks (such as Twitter, Flickr, or other mass dissemination networks) for reporting. The collection point in these applications would simply be authorized to view relevant information from participating clients (either by explicit client-side action or by default such as on Twitter). Social networks, therefore, create unprecedented opportunities for the development of sensing applications, where humans act as sensors or sensor operators, simply by posting their observations or measurements on the shared medium. Resulting social sensing applications, for example, can report traffic speed based on GPS data shared by drivers, or determine damage in the aftermath of a natural disaster based on eye-witness reports. A key problem, when dealing with human sources on social media, is the difficulty in ensuring independence of measurements, making it harder to distinguish fact from rumor. This is because observations posted by one source are available to its neighbors in the social network, who may, in-turn, propagate those observations without verifying their correctness, thus creating correlations and bias. A corner-stone of successful social sensing is therefore to ensure an unbiased sampling of sources that minimizes dependence between them. This paper explores the merits of such diversification. It shows that a diversified sampling is advantageous not only in terms of reducing the number of samples but also in improving our ability to correctly estimate the accuracy of data in social sensing."

The mechanism works for constant per-byte buyer values, private to each buyer, a wide range of stochastic demand models, and is ``detail-free,'' in that the rules operate without knowledge of demand models or network conditions.\nWe show simulation results demonstrating the efficiency gains from dynamic prioritization, as well as the effectiveness of revenue pooling."

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a novel platform for real-time analysis of network traffic based on IBM InfoSphere Streams, which provides deep visibility onto the data objects and communication patterns of users at the application layer in contrast to simple packet- and flow-based analysis that most current systems provide. We discuss our design considerations for such system and further describe three analytics applications that we developed to showcase its capabilities: online identification of heavy-hitters, online social network discovery, and real-time sentiment analysis. We also present performance results from a pilot deployment of this platform and its applications that analyzed Internet traffic generated by users of a large corporate research lab."

In this work we investigate the consequences of this procedure. In particular, we address the impact of an arbitrary $\\\\Delta t$ on the description of a dynamical process taking place upon a time-varying network. We focus on the elementary random walk, and put forth a mathematical framework that provides exact results in the context of synthetic activity-driven networks. Remarkably, the equations turn out to describe accurately also the behavior observed on real datasets. Overall, our analytical description of the bias introduced by time integrating techniques represents a step forward in the correct characterization of dynamical processes on time-varying graphs."

We find that while most relationships tend toward reciprocity, a\nsubstantial minority of relationships exhibit large levels of non-reciprocity. This is puzzling because\nbehavioral theories in social science predict that persons will selectively terminate non-reciprocal\nrelationships, keeping only those that approach reciprocity. We point to two structural features of\nhuman communication behavior and relationship formationthe division of contacts into strong\nand weak ties and degree-based assortativitythat either help or hinder the ability of persons to\nobtain communicative balance in their relationships.We examine the extent to which deviations from\nreciprocity in the observed network are partially traceable to the operation of these countervailing\ntendencies."

        "abstract": "Spatio-temporal attributes represent two aspects of physical presence - space and time - which are integral to human activities. Space-time markers of an entity in conjunction with correlation with other networks such as movements in social network, the road/transportation network encodes a wealth of provenance information. With the advent of mobile computing and cheap and improved location estimation techniques, encoding such information has become commonplace. In this paper, we will focus on deriving such location provenance information from unstructured text generated by social media. As social media such as Facebook and Twitter are integrated with mobile devices, information generated by individuals in these networks gets tagged with spatial markers. We can classify such markers into explicit and implicit tags, where explicit tags encode the spatial data explicitly by providing the accurate location attributes. On the other hand, a lot of social network data may not encode such information explicitly. Our hypothesis in this paper is that the unstructured textual data contains implicit spatial markers at a fine granularity. We develop algorithms to support this hypothesis and evaluate these algorithms on data from FourSquare to show that the spatial category information can be identified with an accuracy of over 80%."

Despite its wide use, it remains unknown how the structure of the network on which it operates affects its performance. Here we show that for random networks the ranking provided by pagerank is sensitive to perturbations in the network topology, making it unreliable for incomplete or noisy systems. In contrast, in scale-free networks we predict analytically the emergence of super-stable nodes whose ranking is exceptionally stable to perturbations. We calculate the dependence of the number of super-stable nodes on network characteristics and demonstrate their presence in real networks, in agreement with the analytical predictions. These results not only deepen our understanding of the interplay between network topology and dynamical processes but also have implications in all areas where ranking has a role, from science to marketing."

We calculate the distribution of control centrality for several real networks and find that it is mainly determined by the networks degree distribution. We show that in a directed network without loops the control centrality of a node is uniquely determined by its layer index or topological position in the underlying hierarchical structure of the network. Inspired by the deep relation between control centrality and hierarchical structure in a general directed network, we design an ecient attack strategy against the controllability of malicious networks."

Among different events, some exhibit strong correlations with the network structure, while others do not. Such structural correlations will shed light on viral influence existing in the corresponding network. Unfortunately, the traditional association mining concept is not applicable in graphs since it only works on homogeneous datasets like transactions and baskets.\n\nWe propose a novel measure for assessing such structural correlations in heterogeneous graph datasets with events. The measure applies hitting time to aggregate the proximity among nodes that have the same event. In order to calculate the correlation scores for many events in a large network, we develop a scalable framework, called gScore, using sampling and approximation. By comparing to the situation where events are randomly distributed in the same network, our method is able to discover events that are highly correlated with the graph structure. We test gScores effectiveness by synthetic events on the DBLP co-author network and report interesting correlation results in a social network extracted from TaoBao.com, the largest online shopping network in China. Scalability of gScore is tested on the Twitter network. Since an event is essentially a temporal phenomenon, we also propose a dynamic measure which reveals structural correlations at specific time steps and can be used for discovering detailed evolutionary patterns."

Decisions at each system \naffect: (i) the time spent in the current state, (ii) a vector of penalties incurred,  and (iii) the next-state transition probabilities.  An example is a network of smart devices that perform separate tasks but share a common wireless\nchannel.  The model can also be applied to data center scheduling and to various types of cyber-physical networks. The combined state space grows exponentially with the number of systems.  However, a simple strategy is developed where each system makes separate decisions. Total complexity grows only linearly in the number of systems, and the resulting performance can be pushed arbitrarily close to optimal. "

A node is critical (and hence should have high betweeness) if it is on many shortest paths. Two shortcomings of such a measure are:\n(i) It ignores nodes on almost shortest paths;\n(ii) It assumes that a node can provide the same attention to information flow through each of those shortest paths, no\nmatter how many shortest paths the node controls.\nThere have been attempts to address these concerns in the literature, with partial success. We provide a new measure, attentive betweenness centrality (ABC), that measures criticality by the amount of attention a node devotes to the information flow between other nodes. Our measure addresses both the aforementioned concerns and can be computed efficiently. It performs as well or better than betweenness centrality on both stylized networks and large scale real data networks, and hence provides a useful tool for measuring node criticality."

This creates a challenge of\ncarefully distinguishing malicious connections from normal ones.\nPrevious work has shown that for a variety of Internet attacks,\nthere is a small subset of connection measurements that are good\nindicators of whether a connection is part of an attack or not.\nIn this paper we look at the effectiveness of using two different\nco-clustering algorithms to both cluster connections as well as\nmark which connection measurements are strong indicators of\nwhat makes any given cluster anomalous relative to the total data\nset. We run experiments with these co-clustering algorithms on\nthe KDD 1999 Cup data set. In our experiments we find that\nsoft co-clustering, running on samples of data, finds consistent\nparameters that are strong indicators of anomalous detections\nand creates clusters, that are highly pure. When running hard\nco-clustering on the full data set (over 100 runs), we on average\nhave one cluster with 92.44% attack connections and the other\nwith 75.84% normal connections.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of RolX on several\nnetwork mining tasks, from exploratory data analysis to network\ntransfer learning. Moreover, we compare network role\ndiscovery with network community discovery. We highlight\nfundamental differences between the two (e.g., roles generalize\nacross disconnected networks, communities do not); and\nshow that the two approach are complimentary in nature."

Our main contributions are: (1) We propose a novel distribution,\nthe Triple Power Law (3PL), that fits the reciprocity behavior of all 3 datasets\nwe study, with a better fit than older competitors, (2) 3PL is parsimonious; it has\nonly three parameters and thus avoids over-fitting, (3) 3PL can spot anomalies,\nand we report the most surprising ones, in our real networks, (4) We observe that\nthe degree of reciprocity between users is correlated with their local topological\nfeatures; reciprocity is higher among mutual users with larger local network\noverlap and greater degree similarity."

A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is its potential to generate many different results, carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. In order to generate desired clustering, we propose to use meta-path, a path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to control clustering with distinct semantics. Nevertheless, it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (seeds) than a weighted combination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus, we propose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects in networks, where a user rst provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster as guidance. Then the system learns the weights for each meta-path that are consistent with the clustering result implied by the guidance, and generates clusters under the learned weights of meta-paths. A probabilistic approach is proposed to solve the problem, and an effective and efcient iterative algorithm, PathSelClus, is proposed to learn the model, where the clustering quality and the meta-path weights are mutually enhancing each other. Our experiments with several clustering tasks in two real networks demonstrate the power of the algorithm in comparison with the baselines. "

        "abstract": "Numerous applications, such as bank transactions, road trafc, and news feeds, generate temporal datasets, in which data evolves continuously. To understand the temporal behavior and characteristics of the dataset and its elements, we need eective tools that can capture evolution of the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel and important problem in evolution behavior discovery. Given a series of snapshots of a temporal dataset, each of which consists of evolving communities, our goal is to nd objects which evolve in a dramatically dierent way compared with the other community members. We dene such objects as community trend outliers. It is a challenging problem as evolutionary patterns are hidden deeply in noisy evolving datasets and thus it is difcult to distinguish anomalous objects from normal ones. We propose an eective two-step procedure to detect community trend outliers. We rst model the normal evolutionary behavior of communities across time using soft patterns discovered from the dataset. In the second step, we propose eective measures to evaluate chances of an object deviating from the normal evolutionary patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach is highly eective in discovering interesting community trend outliers."

        "abstract": "Temporal datasets, in which data evolves continuously, exist in a wide variety of applications, and identifying anomalous or outlying objects from temporal datasets is an important and challenging task. Dierent from traditional outlier detection, which detects objects that have quite dierent behavior compared with the other objects, temporal outlier detection tries to identify objects that have dierent evolutionary behavior compared with other objects. Usually objects form multiple communities, and most of the objects belonging to the same community follow similar patterns of evolution. However, there are some objects which evolve in a very dierent way relative to other community members, and we dene such objects as evolutionary community outliers. This denition represents a novel type of outliers considering both temporal dimension and community patterns. We investigate the problem of identifying evolutionary community outliers given the discovered communities from two snapshots of an evolving dataset. To tackle the challenges of community evolution and outlier detection, we propose an integrated optimization framework which conducts outlier-aware community matching across snapshots and identication of evolutionary outliers in a tightly coupled way. A coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to improve community matching and outlier detection performance iteratively. Experimental results on both synthetic\nand real datasets show that the proposed approach is highly eective in discovering interesting evolutionary community\noutliers."

        "abstract": "Recently, ranking data with respect to the intrinsic geometric structure (manifold ranking) has received considerable attentions, with encouraging performance in many applications in pattern recognition, information retrieval and recommendation systems. Most of the existing manifold ranking methods focus on learning a ranking function that varies smoothly along the data manifold. However, beyond\nsmoothness, a desirable ranking function should vary monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold, such that the ranking order along the geodesics is preserved. In this paper, we aim to learn a ranking function that varies linearly and therefore monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold. Recent theoretical work shows that the gradient eld of a linear function on the manifold has to be a parallel vector eld. Therefore, we propose a novel ranking algorithm on the data manifolds, called Parallel Field Ranking. Specically, we try to learn a ranking function and a vector eld simultaneously. We require the vector eld to be close to the gradient eld of the ranking function, and the vector eld to be as parallel as possible. Moreover, we require the value of the ranking function at the query point to be the highest, and then decrease linearly along the manifold. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real data demonstrate the eectiveness of our proposed algorithm. "

We conduct an extensive, fair comparison of four popular learning methods for the task, reversing conclusions from earlier\nevaluations. Our results hold for different training sets, genres, and feature sets. A second key issue in ESL error correction\nis the adaptation of a model to the first language of the writer. Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities and, as we show, models perform much better when they use knowledge about error patterns of the nonnative writers. We propose a novel way to adapt a learned algorithm to the first language of the writer that is both cheaper to implement and performs better than other adaptation methods. "

The topic of this paper is a related, but stronger problem. Given a social network where neighbors can influence each other, the problem is to identify k nodes such that if a piece of information is placed on each of those k nodes, the overall spread of that information is maximized. The amount of information spread can be measured using existing information propagation models. Recent studies, which focus on quickly finding the k most influential nodes, tend to ignore the overall effect of the influence spread. On the other hand some legacy methods, which look at all possible propagation paths to compute a globally optimal target set, present severe scalability challenges in large-scale networks. We present a simple, yet scalable (poly- nomial time) algorithm that outperforms the existing state-of- the-art, and its success does not depend significantly on any kind of tuning parameter. To be more precise, when compared to the existing algorithms, the output set of k nodes produced by our algorithm facilitates higher information spread  in almost all the instances, consistently across the commonly used information propagation models. The original algorithm in this paper, although scalable, can have higher running time than some standard approaches, e.g. simply picking the top k nodes with highest degree or highest PageRank value. To that end, we provide an optional speedup mechanism that considerably reduces the time complexity while not significantly affecting the quality of results vis-a-vis the benchmarks."

More specifically, members of one of the two networks is responsible for planning and organizing the events. They will generally be referred to as artists. Members of the other network, henceforth called actors, are responsible for the execution of the events. Using temporal data from the performing arts industry, we study the co-evolution of two such co-dependent social networks. We find that the statistical properties of two such networks are highly correlated, and use that finding to devise a prediction mechanism for such properties in a scenario when one of the two networks is invisible or only partially visible. This also sets up a framework for our ultimate goal of temporal, semi-blind, multi-relational link prediction."

There are many dimensions to trust; trust plays an important role in the formation of coalitions in social networks, in assessing quality and credibility of information as well as in determining how information flows through the network. In this paper, we present algorithmically quantifiable measures of trust which can be determined from the communication behavior of the actors in a social communication network. The basis for our study is a proposition that trust results in likely communication behavior patterns which are statistically different from random communication in a network. Detecting the statistically significant realizations of this trust-like behavior allows us to develop a quantitative measure of who-trusts-whom relation in the network. Since our measure of trust is based on quantifiable behavior, we call it behavioral trust. We develop algorithms to efficiently compute behavioral trust and we validate these measures on the Twitter network."

        "abstract": "A fundamental problem in network science is to predict how certain individuals are able to initiate new\nnetworks to spring up new ideas. Frequently, these changes in trends are triggered by a few innovators\nwho rapidly impose their ideas through viral influence spreading, producing cascades of followers and\nfragmenting an old network to create a new one. Typical examples include the rise of scientific ideas or\nabrupt changes in social media, like the rise of Facebook to the detriment of Myspace. How this process\narises in practice has not been conclusively demonstrated. Here, we show that a condition for sustaining a\nviral spreading process is the existence of a multiplex-correlated graph with hidden influence links.\nAnalytical solutions predict percolation-phase transitions, either abrupt or continuous, where networks are\ndisintegrated through viral cascades of followers, as in empirical data. Our modeling predicts the strict\nconditions to sustain a large viral spreading via a scaling form of the local correlation function between\nmultilayers, which we also confirm empirically. Ultimately, the theory predicts the conditions for viral\ncascading in a large class of multiplex networks ranging from social to financial systems and markets."

        "abstract": "It is increasingly common to find real-life data represented as networks of labeled, heterogeneous entities. To query these networks, one often needs to identify the matches of a given query graph in a (typically large) network modeled as a target graph. Due to noise and the lack of fixed schema in the target graph, the query graph can substantially differ from its matches in the target graph in both structure and node labels, thus bringing challenges to the graph querying tasks. In this paper, we propose NeMa (Network Match), a neighborhood-based subgraph matching technique for querying real-life networks. (1) To measure the quality of the match, we propose a novel subgraph matching cost metric that aggregates the costs of matching individual nodes, and unifies both structure and node label similarities. (2) Based on the metric, we formulate the minimum cost subgraph matching problem. Given a query graph and a target graph, the problem is to identify the (top-k) matches of the query graph with minimum costs in the target graph. We show that the problem is NP-hard, and also hard to approximate. (3) We propose a heuristic algorithm for solving the problem based on an inference model. In addition, we propose optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of our method. (4) We empirically verify that NeMa is both effective and efficient compared to the keyword search and various state-of-the-art graph querying techniques. "

Unlike graphs, hypergraphs can capture higher-order interactions in social and communication networks that go beyond a simple union of pairwise relationships. In this paper, we consider the shortest path problem in hypergraphs. We develop two algorithms for finding and maintaining the shortest hyperpaths in a dynamic network with both weight and topological changes. These two algorithms are the first to address the fully dynamic shortest path problem in a general hypergraph. They complement each other by partitioning the application space based on the nature of\nthe change dynamics and the type of the hypergraph. We analyze the time complexity of the proposed algorithms and perform simulation experiments for random geometric hypergraphs, energy efficient routing in multichannel multiradio networks, and the Enron email data set. The last one illustrates the application of the proposed algorithms in social networks for identifying the most important actor based on the closeness centrality metric."

Such heterogeneous level of activity is reminiscent of the well-known and widely applicable law postulated by Pareto, which states that 80% of the effects are induced by 20% of the causes. It is well established that the distribution of social ties (degree) of an individual in a social network follows a power-law distribution. How this heavy-tailed distribution arises in practice, however, has not been conclusively demonstrated. The example of Wikipedia users reported here highlights how heterogeneous the activity of their users are, with both, activity as well as degree following a power-law distribution. Mechanisms of *preferential attachment* are often cited as the origin of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Our data indicate that there is an underlying cause for these phenomena. For two different social networks and different activities performed on them we find an intrinsic relationship between number of followers of a user (degree)\nand the number of posts and edits (activity): The degree distribution is entirely random except for its mean value, and this mean value seems to depend deterministically on the volume of the users' activity. This suggests that heavy-tailed degree distributions might be a consequence of the intrinsic activity of users. Perhaps more importantly, human activity deterministically affects the mean success at establishing links in a social network, but the specific number of links for a given user is otherwise random following a *maximum entropy attachment model*."

We introduce a novel metric for measuring the topic similarity \namong twitter users and compare it to a standard text-based approach. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was applied \nto a one-per-user document collection to compute topic similarity.

This approach can be boosted with semantic knowledge (NLP and entity resolution) to build comparable professional profiles. LinkedVis exposes the hybridization of these methods to the end user in an interactive manner, and allows for user feedback to explore what-if scenarios. The evaluation shows that amplifying social recommendations with semantic data leads to improved personalized content quality in terms of accuracy and diversity."

While there are a great number of studies that introduce methods to find credible data, there is no accepted credibility benchmark. As a result, it is hard to compare different studies and generalize from their findings. In this paper, we argue for a methodology for making such studies more useful to the research community. First, the underlying ground truth values of credibility must be reliable. The specific constructs used to define credibility must be carefully defined. Secondly, the underlying network context must be quantified and documented. To illustrate these two points, we conduct a unique credibility study of two different data sets on the same topic, but with different network characteristics. We also conduct two different user surveys, and construct two additional indicators of credibility based on retweet behavior. Through a detailed statistical study, we first show that survey based methods can be extremely noisy and results may vary greatly from survey to survey. However, by combining such methods with retweet behavior, we can incorporate two signals that are noisy but uncorrelated, resulting in ground truth measures that can be predicted with high accuracy and are stable across different data sets and survey methods. Newsworthiness of tweets can be a useful frame for specific applications, but it is not necessary for achieving reliable credibility ground truth measurements."

First, we propose effective and scalable algorithms to\nsolve these dissemination problems. Second, we conduct a theoretical study of the two problems and our methods, including the\nhardness of the problem, the accuracy and complexity of our methods, and the equivalence between the different strategies and problems. Third and lastly, we conduct experiments on real topologies\nof varying sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of\nour approaches."

The tutorial will contain three parts: (a) Theoretical results on the behavior of fundamental models; (b) Scalable Algorithms for changing the behavior of these processes e.g., for immunization, marketing etc.; and (c) Empirical Studies of diusion on blogs and on-line websites like Twitter. We finally conclude with future research directions. \nThe problems we focus on are central in surprisingly diverse areas: from computer science and engineering, epidemiology and public health, product marketing to information dissemination.

        "abstract": "Large real-life graph data are often distributed to different graph sources. With the growth of these graph sources comes the need of distributed subgraph querying, which is to identify the subgraphs isomorphic to a given query graph over distributed graph sources. Traditional distributed querying typically traverses the graph sources following a prespecified query plan, which may incur high communication cost. Moreover, the communication among the graph sources may not be allowed due to data ownership. To cope with\nthese challenges, in this work we propose a framework, namely, Distributed Subgraph Querying (DiSQ). In contrast to traditional approaches, DiSQ framework (1) evaluates a subgraph query simultaneously over multiple graph sources, which yields a set of local results, and (2) assembles the local results to obtain the final results. DiSQ framework adopts a source index and a generic local search strategy to reduce both the query evaluation time and the communication cost. Better still, DiSQ enables subgraph querying over indepen-\ndent graph sources which may not communicate with each other, where the traditional approaches are not applicable. Using both real-life and synthetic graphs, and by simulating real-life distributed environments, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of DiSQ framework."

        "abstract": "This chapter considers energy-aware control for a computing system with two states: active and idle. In the active state, the controller chooses to perform a single task using one of multiple task processing modes. The controller then saves energy by choosing an amount of time for the system to be idle. These decisions affect processing time, energy expenditure, and an abstract attribute vector that can be used to model other criteria of interest (such as processing quality or distortion). The goal is to optimize time average system performance. Applications of this model include a smart phone that makes energy-efficient computation\nand transmission decisions, a computer that processes tasks subject to rate, quality, and power constraints, and a smart grid energy manager that allocates resources in reaction to a time varying energy price.\n\nThe solution methodology of this chapter uses the theory of optimization for renewal sys- tems developed in [25][30]. Section 9.1 focuses on a computer system that seeks to minimize average power subject to processing rate constraints for different classes of tasks. Section 9.2 generalizes to treat optimization for a larger class of systems. Section 9.3 extends the model to allow control actions to react to a random event observed at the beginning of each active period, such as a vector of current channel conditions or energy prices."

        "abstract": "There has been considerable work developing stochastic network utility maximization framework using Back- pressure algorithms, also known as MaxWeight. A key open problem has been the development of utility-optimal algorithms that are also delay efficient. In this paper, we show that the Backpressure algorithm, when combined with the LIFO queueing discipline (called LIFO-Backpressure), is able to achieve a utility that is within O(1/V) of the optimal value, for any scalar V  1, while maintaining an average delay of O([log(V)]^2) for all but a tiny fraction of the network traffic. This result holds for a general class of problems with Markovian dynamics. Remarkably, the performance of LIFO-Backpressure can be achieved by simply changing the queueing discipline; it requires no other modifications of the original Backpressure algorithm. We validate the results through empirical measurements from a sensor network testbed, which show a good match between theory and practice.\nBecause some packets may stay in the queues for a very long time under LIFO-Backpressure, we further develop the LIFOp- Backpressure algorithm, which generalizes LIFO-Backpressure by allowing interleaving between FIFO and LIFO. We show that LIFOp-Backpressure also achieves the same O(1/V) close-to- optimal utility performance, and guarantees an average delay of O([log(V)]^2) for the packets that are served during the LIFO period."

Here, we analyze empirical data capturing real time ranking in a number of systems, helping to identify the universal characteristics of ranking dynamics. We develop a continuum theory that not only predicts the stability of the ranking process, but shows that a noise-induced phase transition is at the heart of the observed differences in ranking regimes. The key parameters of the continuum theory can be explicitly measured from data, allowing us to predict and experimentally document the existence of three phases that govern ranking stability."

This motivates us to study a problem as follows: given a label budget, how to select data points to label such that the learning performance is optimized. We propose a selective labeling method by analyzing the out-of-sample error of Laplacian regularized Least Squares (LapRLS). In particular, we derive a deterministic out-of-sample error bound for LapRLS trained on subsampled data, and propose to select a subset of data points to label by minimizing this upper bound. Since the minimization is a combinational problem, we relax it into continuous domain and solve it by projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

In this paper, we propose a nonadaptive active learning approach on graphs, based on generalization error bound minimization. In particular, we present a data-dependent error bound for a graph-based learning method, namely learning with local and global consistency (LLGC). We show that the empirical transductive Rademacher complexity of the function class for LLGC provides a natural criterion for active learning. The resulting active learning\napproach is to select a subset of nodes on a graph such that the empirical transductive Rademacher complexity of LLGC is minimized. We propose a simple yet effective sequential optimization algorithm to solve it.

        "abstract": "Effective information sharing and processing are crucial to the success of organizations and teams, especially in information centric environments. One key research problem in building an effective organizational structure is determining how to provide the right information to the right entities [1]. Given a complex networked environment, studying this problem requires modeling behaviors of individuals in organizations based on realistic scenarios. Behavior modeling should take into account social relationships between individuals, such as individuals perceived competence, integrity, and dependability (or reliability). Often past experiences, organizational roles and culture have a significant role in the formation of these relationships. Interpersonal trust has received significant attention as a key relationship that can potentially improve the performance of teams, especially in information sharing tasks. Trust relationships, if they exist, can improve the speed and amount of information sharing. In addition, individuals motives and characteristics may play a role in their behavior. Among the important considerations are the utilitarian assessment of team members contribution to a goal and the allocation of limited cognitive resources. Furthermore, the modeling effort requires an understanding of the impact of the communication network level factors such as connectivity, and bandwidth on team performance. These network level factors further impact individual behavior by changing the cost of mutual interactions. Such a multi-layered model makes it possible to study how social and communication network parameters impact individual behavior and the overall team performance in information intensive tasks. \nThis work has been motivated by the fledgling multidisciplinary research field of network science, where one of its goals is to develop quantitative models of network environments that consider social/cognitive, information, and communication network parameters [2][3]. Within this field, we have observed little work that has studied trust considering these aspects and its impact on team performance. Our work introduces a novel agent model based on multi-aspect trust and develops a simulation environment of a networked team performing an information sharing activity. The multi-aspect trust model integrates factors that impact trust based on social relations, cognitive resources, and communications/networking capabilities. Further, we develop an agent model in which an agent adapts its behavior based on assessed trust of neighboring entities and attempts to maximize its own utility in performing a given task. We incorporate this model into a trust-based information filtering and sharing mechanism to enhance shared situation awareness (SA).\n"

In this study, we investigate the problem of discovering object groups that travel\ntogether (i.e., traveling companions) from trajectory data streams. Such technique has broad applications\nin the areas of scientific study, transportation management and military surveillance. To discover traveling\ncompanions, the monitoring system should cluster the objects of each snapshot and intersect the clustering\nresults to retrieve moving-together objects. Since both clustering and intersection steps involve high computational\noverhead, the key issue of companion discovery is to improve the efficiency of algorithms. We\npropose the models of closed companion candidates and smart intersection to accelerate data processing. A\ndata structure termed traveling buddy is designed to facilitate scalable and flexible companion discovery\nfrom trajectory streams. The traveling buddies are micro-groups of objects that are tightly bound together.\nBy only storing the object relationships rather than their spatial coordinates, the buddies can be dynamically\nmaintained along trajectory stream with low cost. Based on traveling buddies, the system can discover\ncompanions without accessing the object details. In addition, we extend the proposed framework to discover\ncompanions on more complicated scenarios with spatial and temporal constraints, such as on the road network\nand battlefield. The proposed methods are evaluated with extensive experiments on both real and\nsynthetic datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed buddy-based approach is an order of magnitude\nfaster than the baselines and achieves higher accuracy in companion discovery."

In our model we separate the concepts\nof community and topic, so one community can correspond to multiple topics and multiple communities\ncan share the same topic.

Given a subgraph query, our system searches a given large information network and nds efciently a list of subgraphs that are structurally identical and semantically similar. Since data mining methods are used to obtain semantically similar entities (nodes), we use discovery as a term to describe this process. In order to achieve high efciency and scalability, we design and implement a lter-and-verication search framework, which can rst generate promising subgraph candidates using off-line indices built by data mining results, and then verify candidates with a recursive pruning matching process.

It is extremely important for business and administrative decision makers to learn events popularity as quickly as possible, as it can buy extra precious time for them to make informed decisions. Therefore, we introduce the problem of predicting future popularity trend of events on microblogging platforms. Traditionally, trend prediction has been performed by using time series analysis of past popularity to forecast the future popularity changes. As we can encode the rich Twitter dynamics using a rich variety of features from microblogging data, we explore regression, classification and hybrid approaches, using a large set of popularity, social and event features, to predict event popularity. Experimental results on two real datasets of 18382 events extracted from ~133 million tweets show the effectiveness of the extracted features and learning approaches. The predicted popularity trend of events can be directly used for a variety of applications including recommendation systems, ad keywords bidding price decisions, stock trading decisions, dynamic ticket pricing for sports events, etc."

It is important to overcome this bias and know both viewpoints to get a balanced perspective. In this paper, we study various factors that affect learning about the truthfulness of controversial claims. We designed a user study to understand the impact of these factors. Specifically, we studied the impact of presenting evidence with contrasting viewpoints and source expertise rating on how users accessed the evidence documents. This would help us optimize how to teach users about controversial topics in the most effective way, and to design better claim verification systems. We find that users do not seek contrasting viewpoints by themselves, but explicitly presenting contrasting evidence helps them get a well-rounded understanding of the topic. Furthermore, explicit knowledge of the source credibility and the context not only affects what users read, but also how credible they perceive the document to be."

Furthermore, UEM covers existing algorithms like standard EM and hard EM as well as constrained versions of EM such as Constraint-Driven Learning (Chang et al., 2007) and Posterior Regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010). Within the UEM framework, we can adapt the learning procedure to the data, initialization point, and supervision signals like constraints. Experiments on POS tagging, information extraction, and word-alignment show that often the best performing algorithm in the UEM family is a new algorithm that wasnt available earlier, exhibiting the benefits of the UEM framework.

Typically, in structured prediction, an inference\nprocedure is applied to each example independently of the others. In this paper, we seek to optimize the time complexity of inference over entire datasets, rather than individual examples. By considering the general inference representation provided by integer linear programs, we propose three exact inference theorems which allow us to re-use earlier solutions for certain instances, thereby completely avoiding possibly expensive calls to the inference procedure. We also identify several approximation schemes which can provide further speedup. We instantiate these ideas to the structured prediction task of semantic role labeling and show that we can achieve a speedup of over 2.5 using our approach while retaining the guarantees of exactness and a further speedup of over 3 using approximations that do not degrade performance."

We then present an algorithmic approach that jointly optimizes the temporal structure by coupling local classifiers that predict associations and temporal relations between pairs of temporal entities with global constraints. Moreover, we present ways to leverage knowledge provided by event coreference to further improve the system performance. Overall, our experiments show that the joint inference model significantly outperformed the local classifiers by 9.2% of relative improvement in F1. The experiments also suggest that good event coreference could make remarkable contribution to a robust event timeline construction system."

Significant work has been done on developing knowledge sources that could support these tasks, but these resources usually suffer from low coverage, noise, and are inflexible when dealing with ambiguous and general terms that may not appear in any stationary resource, making their use as general purpose background knowledge resources difficult. In this paper, rather than building a hierarchical structure of concepts and relations, we describe an algorithmic approach that, given two terms, determines the taxonomic relation between them using a machine learning-based approach that makes use of existing resources. Moreover, we develop a global constraint-based inference process that leverages an existing knowledge base to enforce relational constraints among terms and thus improves the classifier predictions. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms other systems built upon the existing well-known knowledge sources."

Here we develop a self-consistent theory of dynamical perturbations in complex systems, allowing us to systematically separate the contribution of the network topology and dynamics. The formalism predicts four distinct dynamical universality classes and offers testable predictions regarding the systems response to dynamical perturbations, the correlation function and the distribution of pairwise correlations. We explore several network-based dynamical systems, from protein dynamics\nto epidemic spreading, to offer direct numerical and experimental evidence for the existence of the universality classes and to exploit the predictive power of the developed formalism. By bridging the gap between topology and dynamics our theory resolves a number of long-standing observations in complex systems, such as the broad correlation distributions observed from cellular to neural systems or the paucity of cascades in social environments."

Due to the large scale nature of such networks, it is infeasible to enumerate all user pairs and so sampling is used. In this paper, we show that it is a great challenge even for OSN service providers to characterize user pair relationships even when they possess the complete graph topology. The reason is that when sampling techniques (i.e., uniform vertex sampling (UVS) and random walk (RW)) are naively applied, they can introduce large biases, in particular, for estimating similarity distribution of user pairs with constraints such as existence of mutual neighbors, which is important for applications such as identifying network homophily. Estimating statistics of user pairs is more challenging in the absence of the complete topology information, since an unbiased sampling technique such as UVS is usually not allowed, and exploring the OSN graph topology is expensive. To address these challenges, we present asymptotically unbiased sampling methods to characterize user pair properties based on UVS and RW techniques respectively. We carry out an evaluation of our methods to show their accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we apply our methods to two Chinese OSNs, Doudan and Xiami, and discover significant homophily is present in these two networks."

        "abstract": "This paper studies the relationship between trust and Situation Awareness (SA) in a 3-Player Iterated Diners Dilemma game. We ran an experiment in which 24 participants each played against 2 computer opponents for 6 rounds of iterated Diner's Dilemma decisions, with opponent strategies differing in each round. Based on SA theory and design principles, we developed three different user interfaces that support a specific SA Level. We assess several Trust-related metrics during the study, including percentage of cooperation over time and subjective level of self-reported Trust toward the opponents, and analyze the interdependencies of Trust, SA, and opponent strategy. Results from the experiment reveal highest levels of cooperation at SA Level 1 overall, and a higher level of cooperation for the group of cooperation-encouraging opponent strategies at SA Level 1 and 2 compared to cooperation-discouraging opponent strategies. There is also a positive relationship between self-reported trust in the opponents and cooperation behavior for these strategies, but this relationship was not present in the cooperation-discouraging group. These results indicate that participants do respond to strategy type in terms of behavior, and that cooperation level is a good indicator of the trust that participants place in the opponent players."

        "abstract": "We present a principled approach towards detecting overlapping temporal community structure in dynamic networks. Our method is based on the following framework: find the overlapping temporal community structure that maximizes a quality function associated with each snapshot of the network subject to a temporal smoothness constraint. A novel quality function and a smoothness constraint are proposed to handle overlaps, and a new convex relaxation is used to solve the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. We provide theoretical guarantees as well as experimental results that reveal community structure in real and synthetic networks. Our main insight is that certain structures can be identified only when temporal correlation is considered and when communities are allowed to overlap. In general, discovering such overlapping temporal community structure can enhance our understanding of real-world complex networks by revealing the underlying stability behind their seemingly chaotic evolution. Such an understanding has many applications to communication networks such as distributed content caching, routing in disruption tolerant wireless networks, and devising realistic mobility models for evaluating network protocols."

The large majority of these strategies consider \nthe network as static or adaptive to the spreading processes and the understanding of the effects introduced by \ndynamical connectivity patterns is still limited. In this paper, using the activity driven model framework, we analytically evaluate how different suppressing strategies hamper the diffusion \nprocesses on dynamical networks. We consider the limit in which the evolution of the structure of the network and spreading process are simultaneous yet independent. We analyze three suppressing \nstrategies random, targeted and neighbors immunization/removal of nodes. Consistent with the well known results on static or annealed networks, we find that the random strategy is most inefficient\n to limit the spreading. In this case the threshold of a SIS or SIR process is simply rescaled with respect to the threshold of the basic process when no interventions are implemented. \n On the contrary, the strategy in which the most active nodes are targeted is the most effective way to stop the diffusion. Targeting a small fraction of nodes result in large variations of the threshold. This emphasizes the central role of the activity of each node in the diffusion process in time varying networks. The neighbors scheme only requires local informations of the structure of the network, but suppress the \nspreading quite efficiently. \n"

        "abstract": "The problem of link inference has been widely studied in a variety of social networking scenarios. In this problem, we wish to predict future links in a growing network with the use of the existing network structure. However, most of the existing methods work well only if a significant number of links are already available in the network for the inference process. In many scenarios, the existing network may be too sparse, and may have too few links to enable meaningful learning mechanisms. This paucity of linkage information can be challenging for the link inference problem. However, in many cases, other (more densely linked) networks may be available which show similar linkage structure in terms of underlying attribute information in the nodes. The linkage information in the existing networks can be used {\\\\em in conjunction with the node attribute information} in both networks in order to make meaningful link recommendations. Thus, this paper introduces the use of transfer learning methods for performing cross-network link inference. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach."

Second, what strategies should we use in order that the discovered\nnetwork is statistically similar to the network being discovered, without waiting\nuntil near complete discovery? Previously we proved that on large\nnetworks only walks with time-dependent, that is adaptive, transition probabilities \n(ATP) can generate discovered subgraphs\nthat are statistically similar to the underlying network, before $O(N)$ steps. Here we \npropose a number of ATP-walk based strategies (ATP-swarms) that use visitation \nhistory and restarts (jumps) to previously visited nodes to generate efficient and \nstatistically faithful discovery of social networks. Finally, it may be desirable to keep \nthe clusters discovered by different agents separate as long as possible, e.g., for overlap\nminimization, e.g., for information security reasons. Here we show a modification of \nour ATP-swarms to significantly delay percolation of components, without any \nsignificant effects on the discovery rate.

Since issuing credit entails risks as well as benefits, it is unclear whether self-interested and autonomous agents will form viable credit networks. We tackle this question through an extensive simulation-based game-theoretic analysis of a 61-node credit network formation scenario, covering eight environments varying on information and cost-benefit parameters. We find that viable credit networks form in equilibrium given sufficiently high transaction value, or sufficiently low default risk. Although the amount of credit issued in equilibrium is significantly lower than in the social optimum, as is the social welfare achieved, this difference diminishes proportionally as the environment becomes more favorable overall."

        "abstract": "A number of sensor applications in recent years collect data which can be directly associated with human interactions. Some examples of such applications include GPS applications on mobile devices, accelerometers, or location sensors designed to track human and vehicular traffic. Such data lends itself to a variety of rich applications in which one can use the sensor data in order to model the underlying relationships and interactions. This requires the development of trajectory mining techniques, which can mine the GPS data for interesting social patterns. It also leads to a number of challenges, since such data may often be private, and it is important to be able to perform the mining process without violating the privacy of the users. Given the open nature of the information contributed by users in social sensing applications, this also leads to issues of trust in making inferences from the underlying data. In this chapter, we provide a broad survey of the work in this important and rapidly emerging eld. We also discuss the key problems which arise in the context of this important eld and the corresponding solutions.\n"

We rst identify two aspects of QoI, data reliability and data redundancy, and then propose metrics to estimate them. In particular, reliability implies the degree to which a sensor node contributes to the classication mission, and can be estimated through exploring the agreement between this node and the majority of others. On the other hand, redundancy represents the information overlap among different sensor nodes, and can be measured via investigating the similarity of their clustering results. Based\non the proposed QoI metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that aims at maximizing the reliability of sensory data while eliminating their redundancies under the constraint of network resources. We decompose this problem into a data selection subproblem and a data transmission subproblem, and develop a distributed algorithm to solve them separately. The advantages of our schemes are demonstrated through the simulations on not only synthetic data but also a set of real audio records."

Link prediction in such networks must model the influences between heterogenous relationships and distinguish the formation mechanisms of each link type, a task which is beyond the simple topological features commonly used to score potential links. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistically weighted extension of the Adamic/Adar measure for heterogenous information networks, which we use to demonstrate the potential benefits of diverse evidence, particularly in cases where homogeneous relationships are very sparse. However, we also expose some fundamental flaws of traditional unsupervised link prediction. We develop supervised learning approaches for relationship (link) prediction in multi-relational networks, and demonstrate that a supervised approach to link prediction can enhance performance. We present results on three diverse, real-world heterogeneous information networks and discuss the trends and tradeoffs of supervised and unsupervised link prediction in a multi-relational setting."

Social sensing refers to data collection scenarios where observations are collected from (possibly unvetted) human sources. We call such observations claims to emphasize that we do not know whether or not they are factually correct. Predictable, scalable and robust estimation of both source reliability and claim correctness, given neither in advance, becomes a key challenge given the unvetted nature of sources and lack of means to verify their claims. In a previous conference publication, we proposed a maximum likelihood approach to jointly estimate both source reliability and claim correctness. We also derived confidence bounds to quantify the accuracy of such estimation. In this paper, we extend these results by a systematic sensitivity analysis of the optimal estimator to understand its fundamental accuracy trade-offs. These results offer a comprehensive understanding of attainable fact-finding accuracy as a function of key problem space parameters. It enables assured social sensing, where not only source reliability and claim correctness are estimated (in\nthe presence of unvetted sources), but also the accuracy of such estimates is correctly predicted for the problem at hand."

        "abstract": "We employ user activity data from three highly popular so- cial gifting applications on Facebook to study evolution of user activity on applications through the most commonly- used growth mechanism. We find user activity graphs differ from friendship graphs in large part due to the inherent di- rectionality of user activity and node transience. Our results show that, unlike degree distributions in friendship graphs, activity graphs exhibit strong asymmetry in in- and out- degree distributions, and that out-degrees are not accurately described by any simple parametric distribution (e.g., power law, power law with exponential tail, stretched exponential, lognormal). As such, user activity graphs cannot be simu- lated through existing intent- and feature-driven algorithms that can model friendship graphs.\nWe present a novel probabilistic growth model for user ac- tivity on the gifting genre of social applications. Our model decouples in- and out-degrees based on their distinct na- ture exhibited by our empirical data. We use the insight that regardless of increasing, declining or stable user activ- ity, gifting application user activity exhibits the same graph structure. As in our user activity traces, our model produces synthetic user activity graphs that consist of disconnected components with low clustering of nodes, and exhibit degree structures very similar to our real activity data. We discuss the benefits and shortfalls of our model and its applicability to OSN-based social gaming applications. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first to explore and model user activity growth processes on OSN-based applications."

        "abstract": "This paper explores the design of in-network caching policies for non-independent sensory content. The prob- lem is motivated by sensing applications that collect and store correlated data from the physical world. Physi- cal states exhibit correlations in space and in time that need to be considered in caching decisions. Prior work in sensor networks that exploits correlations between content items focused more on efficient data collection, not caching, whereas work on caching mostly assumed that cached objects are independent. In contrast, when cached objects overlap in information content, such as pictures of a scene taken from different vantage points, the utility from storing similar items is sub-additive, motivating a fresh look at content-aware replacement policies. We describe a new caching policy, called diver- sity caching, that factors-in both popularity and non- independence among objects into cache replacement al- gorithms. We further propose an implementation of this policy that relies on data naming to implicitly ex- press potential redundancy. The policy is evaluated in the context of a disaster-response application, where survivors and first responders survey damage and up- load observations into caches that are queried by others. Evaluation shows that diversity caching substantially improves a notion of coverage over previous replacement policies, such as LRU and Intentional Caching."

Its value is\ncomprised of both intrinsic and contextual attributes related to the\ninformation. Intrinsic attributes include freshness and accuracy\nof the information. Contextual metrics include completeness and\ntimeliness. To design QoI-aware network control algorithms, such\nas resource control algorithms, attributes of data must be mapped\nto QoI. Then, network algorithms may deliver the data in such\na way that the ultimate information derived from the data is of\nsufficient quality for its purpose.We propose our QoI framework,\nand present the concept of QoI functions that capture tradeoffs\nbetween different attributes of QoI. We use optical character\nrecognition (OCR) as a model image processing application.\nWe focus on two attributes of QoI for the OCR application:\naccuracy and timeliness. We show how network controls and data\nprocessing, such as error recovery and compression, operating\non data, impact the QoI delivered to a recipient. We then show\nhow reductions in the required QoI may have a drastic impact\non the amount of network resources required to support a QoI-aware\ntransaction. Our results are based on an implementation\non Android phones."

        "abstract": "The end-user experience in viewing a video depends\non the distortion; however, also of importance is the delay\nexperienced by the packets of the video flow since it impacts\nthe timeliness of the information contained and the playback\nrate at the receiver. Unfortunately, these performance metrics\nare in conflict with each other in a wireless network. Packet\nlosses can be minimized by perfectly avoiding interference by\nseparating transmissions in time or frequency; however, this\ndecreases the rate at which transmissions occur, and this increases\ndelay. Relaxing the requirement for interference avoidance can\nlead to packet losses and thus increase distortion, but can decrease\nthe delay for those packets that are delivered. In this paper,\nwe investigate this trade-off between distortion and delay for\nvideo. To understand the trade-off between video quality and\npacket delay, we develop an analytical framework that accounts\nfor characteristics of the network (e.g. interference, channel\nvariations) and the video content (motion level), assuming as a\nbasis, a simple channel access policy that provides flexibility in\nmanaging the interference in the network. We validate our model\nvia extensive simulations. Surprisingly, we find that the trade-off\ndepends on the specific features of the video flow: it is better to\ntrade-off high delay for low distortion with fast motion video, but\nnot with slow motion video. Specifically, for an increase in PSNR\n(a metric that quantifies distortion) from 20 to 25 dB, the penalty\nin terms of the increase in mean delay with fast motion video is 91\ntimes that with slow motion video. Our simulation results further\nquantify the trade-offs in various scenarios."

At each time slot the channel from the transmitter to each\nreceiver is an independent random variable with two states, high or low,\na_x001B_ecting the amount of data that can be transmitted. Receivers make\n*bids* on the state of their channel and the transmitter allocates rate\naccordingly. Receivers are rewarded for successful transmissions and pe-\nnalized for unsuccessful transmissions. The goal of the transmitter is to\nset the penalties in such a way that even if the receivers are sel_x001C_sh, the\ndata forwarded is close to the optimal transmission rate. We _x001C_rst model\nthis problem as a single shot game in which the receivers know the chan-\nnel probability distributions but the transmitter does not, and show that\nit is possible for the transmitter to set penalties so as to ensure that both\nreceivers have a dominant strategy and the corresponding Price of An-\narchy is bounded by 2. We show, moreover, that this is in a sense the\nbest possible bound. We next consider the case when receivers have in-\ncomplete information on the distributions, and numerically evaluate the\nperformance of a distributed online learning algorithm based on the well-\nknown UCB1 policy for this case. From simulations, we _x001C_nd that use of\nUCB1 policy yields a performance close to the dominant strategy."

        "abstract": "In pervasive computing and sensing applications, a multitude of devices such as sensors\nand processors (that perform fusion) serve as rich sources of data and information over\nlong periods of time. It is often the case that the information streams generated inside\nan application are not independent of each other; instead, they have certain semantic\nrelationships between them. In order to deal with high volumes of information generated\nover time, it is sometimes necessary to compress these information streams. However, it\nis often the case that the underlying meaning or semantics of the information is what is\ncritical for maintaining an acceptable level of information quality, rather than the actual\ndata in its entirety. In this paper, we show how semantic redundancy and ambiguity\nwithin a semantically-aware source can be exploited to achieve compression with a goal\nof being able to recover the meaning underlying its messages. We take the preliminary\nsteps to extend the source coding principles of classical information theory and show that\nby utilizing semantic inference relations between probabilistically expressed messages\nand underlying models at the source, a higher rate of compression, albeit lossy, may be\nachieved compared to traditional syntactic compression methods. We define a semantic\nentropy measure for a source and show that it is bounded from above by the mutual\ninformation between its models and the syntactic messages it generates. We also consider\nsome simple graph based semantic inference relationships derived from propositional logic\nand give practical algorithms that exploit the graph structure of a shared knowledge base\nto facilitate lossless semantic compression."

        "abstract": "Link prediction and recommendation is a funda- mental problem in social network analysis. The key challenge of link prediction comes from the sparsity of networks due to the strong disproportion of links that they have potential to form to links that do form. Most previous work tries to solve the problem in single network, few research focus on capturing the general principles of link formation across heterogeneous networks.\nIn this work, we give a formal definition of link recom- mendation across heterogeneous networks. Then we propose a ranking factor graph model (RFG) for predicting links in social networks, which effectively improves the predictive perfor- mance. Motivated by the intuition that people make friends in different networks with similar principles, we find several social patterns that are general across heterogeneous networks. With the general social patterns, we develop a transfer-based RFG model that combines them with network structure information. This model provides us insight into fundamental principles that drive the link formation and network evolution. Finally, we verify the predictive performance of the presented transfer model on 12 pairs of transfer cases. Our experimental results demonstrate that the transfer of general social patterns indeed help the prediction of links."

We argue that the practical performance potential of these methods is generally unknown because of challenges endemic to evaluation in many link prediction contexts. We demonstrate that current methods of evaluation are inadequate and can lead to woefully errant conclusions about practical performance potential. We argue for the use of precision-recall threshold curves and associated areas in lieu of receiver operating characteristic curves due to the extreme imbalance of the link prediction classification problem. We provide empirical examples of how current methods lead to questionable conclusions, how the fallacy of these conclusions is illuminated by methods we propose, and suggest a fair and consistent framework for link prediction evaluation for longitudinal and non-longitudinal network data sets."

        "abstract": "This thesis develops the fundamental theory and methodology for quantifying the Quality of Information (QoI) in social sensing. We refer social sensing to the sensing applications where humans play a critical role in the sensing or data collection process. Social sensing has emerged as a new paradigm for sensory data collection, which is motivated by the proliferation of mobile platforms equipped with a variety of sensors (e.g., GPS, camera, microphone, motion and etc.) in the possession of common individuals, networking capabilities that enable fast and convenient data sharing (e.g., WiFi and 4G) and large-scale dissemination of opportunities (Twitter, Flicker and etc.). A significant challenge in social sensing applications lies in ascertaining the correctness of collected data and the reliability of information sources. We call this challenge QoI quantification in social sensing. Unlike the case with well-calibrated and well-tested infrastructure sensors, humans are less reliable. The term, participant (or source) reliability is used to denote the probability that the participant reports correct observations. Reliability may be impaired because of poor used sensor quality, lack of sensor calibration, lack of (human) attention to the task, or even intent to deceive. Moreover, data collection is often open to a large population, where it is impossible to screen all participants beforehand. The likelihood that a participants measurements are correct is usually unknown a priori. Consequently, it is very challenging to ascertain the correctness of the collected data from unreliable sources with unknown reliability. Meanwhile, it is also challenging to ascertain the reliability of each information source without knowing whether their collected data are true or not. Therefore, the main questions posed in this thesis are: i) whether or not we can determine, in an optimal way, given only the measurements collected and without knowing the reliability of sources, which of the reported observations are true and which are not? ii) whether a source (participant) is reliable or not? iii) how to quantify the answers of the above questions? The thesis answers the above questions by applying the key insights from estimation theory and data fusion to come up with new theories to accurately quantify both the participant reliability and correctness of their observations for social sensing applications.

The work is motivated by the emergence of social sensing as a data collection paradigm of growing interest, where humans perform sensory data collection tasks. Unlike the case with well-calibrated and well-tested infrastructure sensors, humans are less reliable, and the likelihood that participants measurements are correct is often unknown a priori. Given a set of human participants of unknown trustworthiness together with their sensory measurements, we pose the question of whether one can use this information alone to determine, in an analytically founded manner, the probability that a given measurement is true. In our previous conference paper, we offered the first maximum likelihood solution to the above truth discovery problem for corroborating observations only. In contrast, this paper extends the conference paper and provides the first maximum likelihood solution to handle the cases where measurements from different participants may be conflicting. The paper focuses on binary measurements. The approach is shown to outperform our previous work used for corroborating observations, the state of the art fact-finding baselines, as well as simple heuristics such as majority voting."

Detecting gold farmers or other deviant actors in social systems is traditionally understood as a binary classification problem, but the issue of false negatives is significant for administrators as residual actors can serve as the backbone for subsequent clandestine organizing. In this paper we address this gap in the literature by addressing the problem of false negative estimation for gold farmers in MMOs by employing the capture-recapture technique for false negative estimation and combine it with graph clustering techniques to determine *hidden* gold farmers in social networks of farmers and normal players. This paper redefines the problem of gold farming as a false negative estimation problem and estimates the gold farmers in co-extensive MMO networks, previously undetected by the game administrators. It also identifies these undetected gold farmers using graph partitioning techniques and applies network data to address rare class classification problem. The experiments in this research found 53% gold farmers who were previously undetected by the game administrators.  "

Game logs capture player activities in great detail and user behavior modeling approaches can help to build accurate models of player behavior from these logs. We are interested in modeling player churn behavior and we use a lifecycle-based approach for this purpose. In a player lifecycle-based approach, we analyze the activity traits of churners in the weeks leading up to their point of leaving the game and compare it with the activity traits of a regular player.We identify several intuitive yet distinct behavioral profiles associated with churners and active players which can discriminate between the two populations. We use these insights to propose three semantic dimensions of engagement, enthusiasm and persistence to construct derived features. Using three session related variables and the features derived from them, we are able to achieve good classification performance with the churn prediction models. Finally, we propose a distance-based classification scheme, which we call wClusterDist, which benefits from these distinct behavioral profiles of the two populations. Experimental results show that the proposed classification scheme is well-suited for this problem formulation and its performance is better than or comparable to other traditional classification schemes."

But in many distributed teams, formal leaders often find themselves responsible for the teams goals without having direct authority over the teams members. In this paper we examine both the teams performance and the leaders personal performance from the perspective of the leaders reputation within the team. We hypothesized that leaders who are well regarded by their team will have stronger individual and group performance ratings.  We tested our hypotheses among leaders of 31 distributed sales teams.  Using objective measures of individual and team performance we confirmed that well-regarded leaders have better individual but not team performance ratings. Conversely, teams but not their leaders performed better when the leader had a positive regard for the team.  We discuss the implications of these findings for leadership in the context of distributed, self-directed, or other types of groups in which leaders do not have formal authority over team members. "

A challenge\nin all of these scenarios is the large size of real-world networks and the\ncomputational complexity associated with clique enumeration. Further-\nmore, when mining for multiple cliques within the same network, the\nresults need to be diversified in order to extract meaningful information\nthat is both comprehensive and representative of the whole dataset.\n\nWe formalize the problem of weighted diverse clique mining (mDkC)\nin large networks, incorporating both individual clique strength (mea-\nsured by its weakest link) and diversity of the cliques in the result set.\nWe show that the problem is NP-hard due to the diversity requirement.\nHowever, our formulation is sub-modular, and hence can be approxi-\nmated within a constant factor from the optimal. We propose algorithms\nfor mDkC that exploit the edge weight distribution in the input network\nand produce performance gains of more than 3 orders of magnitude com-\npared to an exhaustive solution. One of our algorithms, Diverse Cliques\n( DiCliQ), guarantees a constant factor approximation while the other,\nBottom Up Diverse Cliques ( BUDiC), scales to large and dense networks\nwithout compromising the solution quality.

DRS-Gen captures the dynamic graph properties of connectivity and reachability, as well as generates time values for its edges. To the best of our knowledge, DRS-Gen is the _x000C_rst such model which produces exact time values on edges, allowing us to understand simultaneity across multiple\ninformation flows."

QoI, tailored for military tactical\nnetworks, is defined by a set of attributes relevant to the\napplication. Time-varying nature of links in practical networks\nleads to uncertainty in evaluating QoI utility to be delivered\nto end users. This delivered-QoI utility is a function of both\nattributes provided by the source input, as a result of observing\ncertain events, and the channel induced attributes that impact\nthe QoI obtained at the destination. The goal of this paper is to\nattain the maximum QoI output utility, termed as Operational\nInformation Content Capacity (OICC) of a network. First,\nfor a single link, we demonstrate that the optimal decision\nstructure for transmission is threshold-based. Next, we consider\nmultihop relay networks. For the basic model of a two-hop\nrelay network, we propose transmission scheduling and link\nactivation schemes based on approximate dynamic programming\nmethods. Furthermore, we exploit time-variations of links by\nopportunistic scheduling by employing buffers at the relay node.\nWe demonstrate that significant gains in QoI output utility are\ngained by opportunistic scheduling algorithms."

A thorough comparison of different algorithms (a total of fourteen) is provided. In addition to community level evaluation, we propose a framework for evaluating algorithms ability to detect overlapping nodes, which helps to assess over-detection and underdetection.\nAfter considering community level detection performance measured by Normalized Mutual Information, the Omega index, and node level detection performance measured by Fscore, we reached the following conclusions. For low overlapping density networks, SLPA, OSLOM, Game and COPRA offer better performance than the other tested algorithms. For networks with high overlapping density and high overlapping diversity, both SLPA and Game provide relatively stable performance. However, test results also suggest that the detection in such networks is still not yet fully resolved. A common feature observed by various algorithms in real-world networks is\nthe relatively small fraction of overlapping nodes (typically less than 30%), each of which belongs to only 2 or 3 communities."

First, we use axiomatic foundations to rigorously establish shorter, strongly-connected evolutions. In the second step, we use heuristics to combine these shorter evolutions to form longer evolutions. We apply the procedure on data generated from two networks - the DBLP co-authorship database and LiveJournal blog data. We visually validate our algorithms by examining the topic evolution of the associated documents. Our results demonstrate that our algorithms, based solely on structural properties of the data (who interacts with whom), are able to track thematic trends in the literature. We then use a machine learning framework to identify the structural features of the early stages of a communitys evolution are most useful for predicting the lifetime of the community. We find that (in order) size, intensity and stability are the most important features."

As a result, it presents tremendous potential for people to promulgate their own points of view; such efforts may be more subtle than typical vandalism. In this paper, we introduce new behavioral metrics to quantify the level of controversy associated with a particular user: a Controversy Score (C-Score) based on the amount of attention the user focuses on controversial pages, and a Clustered Controversy Score (CC-Score) that also takes into account topical clustering. We show that both these measures are useful for identifying people who try to push their points of view, by showing that they are good predictors of which editors get blocked. The metrics can be used to triage potential POV pushers. We apply this idea to a dataset of users who requested promotion to administrator status and easily identify some editors who significantly changed their behavior upon becoming administrators. At the same time, such behavior is not rampant. Those who are promoted to administrator status tend to have more stable behavior than comparable groups of prolific editors. This suggests that the Adminship process works well, and that the Wikipedia community is not overwhelmed by users who become administrators to promote their own points of view."

Our ODE reveals the change in dynamical behavior of the Naming Game as a function of the average degree < k > of an uncorrelated network. This result is in good agreement with the numerical results. We also analyze the extended NG model that allows for presence of 10 committed nodes and show that there is a shift of the tipping point for social consensus in sparse networks."

Accordingly, the number of research papers published in CS conferences and journals has been increasing rapidly for the past two decades. With growing emphasis on externally funded research in most universities, scientific research is increasingly influenced by funding opportunities. Although many funded programs are developed in close collaboration with leading researchers, we aim here to identify more precisely relationships between funding and publications related to new topics."

        "abstract": "Real-world, multiple-typed objects are often interconnected, forming heterogeneous information networks. A major challenge\nfor link-based clustering in such networks is its potential to generate many different results, carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. In order to generate desired clustering, we propose to use meta-path, a path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to control clustering with distinct semantics. Nevertheless, it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (seeds) than a weighted combination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus, we propose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects in networks, where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster as guidance. Then the system learns the weights for each meta-path that are consistent with the clustering result implied by the guidance, and generates clusters under the learned weights of meta-paths. A probabilistic approach is proposed to solve the problem, and an effective and efficient iterative algorithm, PathSelClus, is proposed to learn the model, where the clustering quality and the meta-path weights are mutually enhancing each other. Our experiments with several clustering tasks in two real networks and one synthetic network demonstrate the power of the algorithm in comparison with the baselines."

        "abstract": "A frequent problem when dealing with data gathered from multiple sources on the web (ranging from booksellers to Wikipedia pages to stock analyst predictions) is that these sources disagree, and we must decide which of their (often mutually exclusive) claims we should accept. Current state-of-the-art information credibility algorithms known as *fact-finders* are transitive voting systems with rules specifying how votes iteratively flow from sources to claims and then back to sources. While this is quite tractable and often effective, fact-finders also suffer from substantial limitations; inparticular, a lack of transparency obfuscates their credibility decisions and makes them difficult to adapt and analyze: knowing the mechanics of how votes are calculated does notreadily tell us what those votes mean, and finding, for example, that a source has a score of 6 is not informative. We introduce a new approach to information credibility, Latent Credibility Analysis (LCA), constructing strongly principled, probabilistic models where the truth of each claim is a latent variable and the credibility of a source is captured by a set of model parameters. This gives LCA models clear semantics and modularity that make extending them to capture additional observed and latent credibility factors straightforward. Experiments over four real-world datasets demonstrate that LCA models can outperform the best fact-finders in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings."

Unfortunately, there are no automated systems currently available that can classify a medical webpage as being reliable, while manual assessment cannot scale up to process the large number of medical pages on the Web. We propose a supervised learning approach to automatically predict reliability of medical webpages. We developed a gold standard dataset using the standard reliability criteria defined by the Health on Net Foundation and systematically experimented with different link and content based feature sets. Our experiments show promising results with prediction accuracies of over 80%. We also show that our proposed prediction method is useful in applications such as reliability-based re-ranking and automatic website accreditation."

Sentiment analysis on such kinds of data can no longer ignore the information network, since it carries a lot of rich and valuable information, explicitly or implicitly, where some of them can be observed while others are not. In this paper, we propose a novel information network-based framework which can infer hidden similarity and dissimilarity between users by exploring similar and opposite opinions, so as to improve post-level and user-level sentiment classification in the same time.\nMore specifically, we develop a new meta path-based measure for inferring pseudo-friendship as well as dissimilarity\nbetween users, and propose a semi-supervised refining model by encoding similarity and dissimilarity from both user-level\nand post-level relations. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach and compare with several state-of-the-art\ntechniques on two real-world forum datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed model with 10.5% labeled\nsamples can achieve better performance than a traditional supervised model trained on 61.7% data samples."

To integrate information from multiple views in the unsupervised setting, multi-view clustering algorithms have been developed to cluster multiple views simultaneously to derive a solution which uncovers the common latent structure shared by multiple views. In this paper, we propose a novel NMF-based multi-view clustering algorithm by searching for a factorization that gives compatible clustering solutions across multiple views. The key idea is to formulate a joint matrix factorization process with the constraint that pushes clustering solution of each view towards a common consensus instead of fxing it directly. The main challenge is how to keep clustering solutions across different views meaningful and comparable. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel and effective normalization strategy inspired by the connection between NMF and PLSA. Experimental results on synthetic and several real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

This tool was built with the aim of assisting journalists both with gathering and with researching news stories as users comment on them. Five journalism professionals who tested the tool found helpful characteristics that could assist them with gathering additional facts on breaking news, as well as facilitating discovery of potential information sources such as witnesses in the geographical locations of news."

People have defined different fitness measures (modularity, conductance, etc.) to quantify such correlation, and group the nodes by optimizing a certain fitness measure. However, a particular grouping with desired semantics, as the target of the detection, is not promised to be detectable by each measure. We study a fundamental problem in the process of node grouping discovery: Given a particular grouping in a network, whether and to what extent it can be discovered with a given fitness measure. We propose two approaches of testing the detectability, namely ranking-based and correlation-based randomization tests. Our methods are evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets, which shows the proposed methods can effectively predict the detectability of groupings of various types, and support explorative process of node grouping discovery."

Several different approaches to community detection and modeling were applied to this generated dataset, in order to compare the strengths and range of applicability of different algorithms. Graph partitioning methods performed well at assigning membership to formal, exclusive groups such as organizational departments, if there is a priori knowledge of the target number of groups. SSDE-cluster, a fast and scalable algorithm, performed well in detecting normal departments and can be used when the number of groups is not known. It also was able to detect small overlapping groups, but with only moderate accuracy. Clique enumeration performed well in detecting small overlapping groups, when a priori knowledge of average group size was used. Different methods of constructing social network graphs from the mixed communication actions were investigated, as well as different link weighing methods. We conclude that behavior-generated datasets with complex and complete ground truths are useful for collaborative validation of different community and role detection and modeling methods."

        "abstract": "Team collaboration in multi-player online games provides opportunities for players to interact with each other.  Facilitating teams has become one of the main design principles to increase social activities.  However, there is no research evidence that collaborating on tasks in game teams can produce the desired relational outcome.  This paper examines more than half a million solo and team activities during a week in Dragon Nest, an MMO game.  We measure the degree of team engagement using the percentage of time played in teams and the percentage of play with repeated teammates, and we then identify different types of players using this.  The results show that solo players and team players are two distinct populations and they are highly predictable based on players' in-game status.  Moreover, we find that spending more time in teams does not always lead to more social interactions.  The interviews with players are conducted to validate the findings."

        "abstract": "This study investigates unfollow behavior in Twitter, i.e., people removing others from their Twitter following lists.  Considering the interdependency and dynamics of unfollow decisions, we use actor-oriented modeling (SIENA) to examine the impacts or reciprocity, status, embeddedness, homophily, and informativeness on tie dissolution.  Focusing on ordinary users in tightly-knitted user groups, the results show that relational properties play key roles in the emergence of unfollow behavior: mutual following relations and common followees reduce the likelihood of unfollowing.  And unfollow tends to be reciprocal: when a user in unfollowed by someone, he or she will unfollow back.  However, there is no evidence of the impacts of homophily based on common interests and informativeness of interactions.  The findings suggest that Twitter has many heterogeneous user groups and relational and informational factors may not be applicable universally. "

Each user may already have certain popular files in its cache. The remaining devices are access points that typically have a larger set of files. Users can download packets of their requested file from an access point or from another user. A dynamic algorithm that opportunistically grabs packets from current neighbors is developed. Under a simple model where each user desires a single file with infinite length, the algorithm is shown to optimize utility while incentivizing participation. The algorithm extends as an efficient heuristic in more general cases with finite file sizes and random active and idle periods. Example simulations demonstrate the dramatic throughput gains enabled by wireless peering."

We formulate the problem as a dynamic network utility maximization and observe that it naturally decomposes into two subproblems: admission control and transmission scheduling. The resulting al- gorithms are simple and suitable for distributed implementation. The admission control decisions involve each user choosing the quality of the video chunk asked for download, based on the network congestion in its neighborhood. This form of admission control is compatible with the current video streaming technology based on the DASH protocol over TCP connections. We also consider a mechanism for dropping bits from the transmission queues in order to obtain deterministic bounds on the queueing delays, which determine the number of video chunks that should be pre-fetched in order to guarantee smooth playback without interruptions."

        "abstract": "An information collection problem in a wireless net- work with random events is considered. Wireless devices report on each event using one of multiple reporting formats. Each format has a different quality and uses different data lengths. Delivering all data in the highest quality format can overload sys- tem resources. The goal is to make intelligent format selection and routing decisions to maximize time-averaged information quality subject to network stability. Lyapunov optimization theory can be used to solve such a problem by repeatedly minimizing the linear terms of a quadratic drift-plus-penalty expression. To reduce delays, this paper proposes a novel extension of this technique that preserves the quadratic nature of the drift minimization while maintaining a fully separable structure. In addition, to avoid high queuing delay, paths are restricted to at most two hops. The resulting algorithm can push average information quality arbitrarily close to optimum, with a trade-off in queue backlog. The algorithm compares favorably to the basic drift- plus-penalty scheme in terms of backlog and delay. Furthermore, the technique is generalized to solve linear programs and yields smoother results than the standard drift-plus-penalty scheme."

        "abstract": "Information in tactical networks is being generated at an ever\nincreasing pace. This is requiring networks to distribute the\ninformation processing in an efficient and intelligent way. Command\nand control (C2) theory suggests that the performance of such networks\nor organizations is dependent on the overall topology of the network\nand other parameters or characteristics of the constituent nodes, such\nas their ability to filter information. Traditional information\nsharing policies use static approaches and operate on a\n``need-to-know'' basis. The more network-enabled approach is to\n``share-before-process'', which introduces more dynamism and\nrobustness to the system. However, no model exists to this day to\nappropriately study the trade-offs introduced by these different\norganizational structures. This paper proposes the use of an agent\nmodel in which agents consider two constructs, willingness and\ncompetence, when deciding with whom to share information. We show that\nthese two constructs are general enough to capture organizational\nstructures based on strict as well as shared governance\nrules. Furthermore, these constructs have clear analogues in cognitive\npsychology, which allows us to incorporate trust into the agent models\nin a seamless manner. Through simulation, we study an information\nsharing scenario based on this agent model in different organizational\nstructures. We illustrate the trade-offs between situation awareness\n(SA) gained and network overhead in terms of communications and time\nrequired to reach a steady-state SA.\n"

        "abstract": "This paper describes a machine learning approach to evaluate the relationship between trust behavior and Situation Awareness (SA) in the context of a 3-player Iterated Diners Dilemma game. Our experimental setup consisted of a set of 24 supervised studies in which participants played against computer opponents with different cooperation strategies. Three user interfaces were evaluated in the study, each corresponding to a specific level of SA (Perception, Comprehension, and Projection). Two concepts of trust are explored in the study: Empirical trust behavior was recorded as the degree of cooperation imparted by the participant in a given condition, and Self-reported trust assessments were also collected at regular intervals throughout the study. To explore the relations that exist between these two\nconcepts of trust, and different SA Level conditions, a machine learning approach was applied to train a variety of models to accurately predict trust behavior in each condition. Our best performing algorithm was a J48 rule-based learner, which leveraged SA Level, strategy, and self-reported survey data to predict trust behavior to 76% accuracy, and 67% accuracy using only SA Level and opponent strategy. This is a relative increase of 43% and 24% respectively over a benchmark majority class predictor. These results indicate that support at a level of SA and opponent strategy are good predictors of trust behavior in the Iterated Diners Dilemma game. Our results also show that trust-prediction models perform best when they are trained on a combination of self-reported data, and strategy / SA Level information.\n"

Here we study the impact of various network characteristics on the minimal number of driver nodes required to control a network. We find that clustering and modularity have no discernible impact, but the symmetries of the underlying matching problem can produce linear, quadratic or no dependence on degree correlation coefficients, depending on the nature of the underlying correlations. The results are supported by numerical simulations and help narrow the observed gap between the predicted and the observed number of driver nodes in real networks."

        "abstract": "Our ability to control complex systems is a fundamental challenge of contemporary science. Recent advances in applying control theory to complex networks have offered the tools to identify the driver nodes, through which we can achieve full control of a system. These tools predict the existence of multiple control configurations, prompting us to classify each node in a network based on their role in control: a node is critical if a system can not be controlled without it, intermittent if it acts as a driver node only in some configurations and redundant if it does not play a role in control. Here we develop an analytical framework to identify the category of each node in an arbitrary network. This framework helps us discover a bimodal phenomena, indicating that dense networks display either a centralized control mode, being driven by only a tiny fraction of nodes, or a distributed control mode, when most nodes play some role in controlling the system. We predict the control mode for an arbitrary network and show that one can alter it through small structural perturbations. The uncovered bimodality has implications from network security to organizational research and offers new insights into the dynamics and control of complex systems."

        "abstract": "A quantitative description of a complex system is inherently limited by our ability to estimate the systems internal state from experimentally accessible outputs. While the simultaneous measurement of all internal variables, like all metabolite concentrations in a cell, offers a complete description of a systems state, in practice experimental access is limited to only a subset of variables, or sensors. A system is called observable if we can reconstruct the systems complete internal state from its outputs. Here we adopt a graphical approach derived from the dynamical laws that govern a system to determine the sensors that are necessary to reconstruct the full internal state of a complex system. We apply this approach to biochemical reaction systems, finding that the identified sensors are not only necessary but also sufficient for observability. The developed approach can also identify the optimal sensors for target or partial observability, helping us reconstruct selected state variables from appropriately chosen outputs, a prerequisite for optimal biomarker design. Given the fundamental role observability plays in complex systems, these results offer new avenues to systematically explore the dynamics of a wide range of natural, technological and socioeconomic systems."

        "abstract": "Given a large number of taxi trajectories, we would like to find interesting and unexpected patterns from the data. How can we summarize the major trends, and how can we spot anomalies? The anal- ysis of trajectories has been an issue of considerable interest with many applications such as tracking trails of migrating animals and predicting the path of hurricanes. Several recent works propose methods on clus- tering and indexing trajectories data. However, these approaches are not especially well suited to pattern discovery with respect to the dynamics of social and economic behavior. To further analyze a huge collection of taxi trajectories, we develop a novel method, called F-Trail, which al- lows us to find meaningful patterns and anomalies. Our approach has the following advantages: (a) it is fast, and scales linearly on the input size, (b) it is effective, leading to novel discoveries, and surprising outliers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, by performing exper- iments on real taxi trajectories. In fact, F-Trail does produce concise, informative and interesting patterns."

Targeting\nnodes to immunize based on their network interactions\nhas been shown to be far more e_x000B_ective at stemming\ninfection spread than immunizing random subsets of\nnodes. However, the assumption that selected nodes\ncan be rendered completely immune does not hold for\ninfections for which there is no vaccination or e_x000B_ective\ntreatment. Instead, one can confer fractional immu-\nnity to some nodes by allocating variable amounts of\ninfection-prevention resource to them. We formulate the\nproblem to distribute a _x000C_xed amount of resource across\nnodes in a network such that the infection rate is mini-\nmized, prove that it is NP-complete and derive a highly\ne_x000B_ective and e_x000E_cient linear-time algorithm. We demon-\nstrate the e_x000E_ciency and accuracy of our algorithm com-\npared to several other methods using simulation on real-\nworld network datasets including US-MEDICARE and\nstate-level interhospital patient transfer data. We _x000C_nd\nthat concentrating resources at a small subset of nodes\nusing our algorithm is up to 6 times more e_x000B_ective\nthan distributing them uniformly (as is current prac-\ntice) or using network-based heuristics.

Graph sim- ilarity with known node correspondence, i.e. the detection of changes in the connectivity of graphs, is a problem that arises in numerous settings. In this work, we formally state the ax- ioms and desired properties of the graph similarity measures, and evaluate when state-of-the-art methods fail to detect cru- cial connectivity changes in graphs. We propose DELTA- CON, a principled, intuitive, and scalable algorithm that as- sesses the similarity between two graphs on the same nodes (e.g. employees of a company, customers of a mobile car- rier, users of a web service), while satisfying the axioms and properties. A series of experiments on various synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over ex- isting similarity measures. Finally, we employ DELTACON to real applications: we classify people to groups of high and low creativity based on their brain connectivity graphs, and do temporal anomaly detection in the who-emails-whom En- ron graph. In the latter case, DELTACON successfully detects anomalous days, which coincide with major events in the history of the notorious company."

Hidden in those unstructured data are the strong relevance relationships between those entities, which are critical for many interesting applications including building knowledge bases for the biomedical domain and semantic search among biomedical entities. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering strong relevance between heterogeneous typed biomedical entities from massive biomedical text data. We first build an entity correlation graph from data, in which the collection of paths linking two heterogeneous entities offer rich semantic contexts for their relationships, especially those paths following the patterns of top-k selected meta paths inferred from data. Guided by such meta paths, we design a novel relevance measure to compute the strong relevance between two heterogeneous entities, named . Our intuition is, two entities of heterogeneous types are strongly relevant if they have strong direct links or they are linked closely to other strongly relevant heterogeneous entities along paths following the selected patterns. We provide experimental results on mining strong relevance between drugs and diseases. More than 20 millions of MEDLINE abstracts and 5 types of biological entities (Drug, Disease, Compound, Target, MeSH) are used to construct the entity correlation graph. A prototype of drug search engine for disease queries is implemented. Extensive comparisons are made against multiple state-of-the-arts in the examples of DrugDisease relevance discovery."

The goal of selective sampling is to achieve a good trade-off between prediction performance and\nthe number of queried labels. Existing selective sampling algorithms are designed for vector-based data. In this paper,\nmotivated by the ubiquity of graph representations in realworld applications, we propose to study selective sampling\non graphs. We first present an online version of the well-known Learning with Local and Global Consistency method\n(OLLGC). It is essentially a second-order online learning algorithm, and can be seen as an online ridge regression in the\nHilbert space of functions defined on graphs. We prove its regret bound in terms of the structural property (cut size)\nof a graph, or the spectral property of graph Laplaican. Based on OLLGC, we present a selective sampling algorithm,\nnamely Selective Sampling with Local and Global Consistency (SSLGC), which queries the label of each node\nbased on the confidence of the linear function on graphs. Its bound on the label complexity is also derived. We analyze\nthe low-rank approximation of graph kernels, which enables the online algorithms scale to large graphs. Experiments\non benchmark graph datasets show that OLLGC outperforms the state-of-the-art first-order algorithm significantly,\nand SSLGC achieves comparable or even better results than OLLGC while querying substantially fewer nodes. Moreover,\nSSLGC is overwhelmingly better than random sampling."

        "abstract": "Document representation is a fundamental problem for text mining. Many techniques have been proposed to represent documents,\nsuch as bag-of-words, phrase, sentence and topic-level descriptions. However, most of the current methods fail at fully capturing\nthe semantic meanings in documents. In this paper, we propose the use of frame-based representations to semantically describe documents from a comparable corpus (e.g., news articles about Japans Tsunami) using an information network approach. In our approach, each document is summarized by a bag of frames, where each frame is arranged as a triplet that consists of subject, object, and verb along with its linguistic modifiers. A major challenge we address in this solution is that semantically similar frames that appear\nin different documents may be of different forms. For example, quake struck Japan in one news article can appear as a massive\nearthquake hit Japan in another article. Our solution constructs an information network among triplets and words, computes the\nsimilarity between triplets using a link-based similarity measure called SynRank, and clusters synonymous triplets into the same\ngroup. As a result, different variations of the semantically similar triples/frames can be merged into a single descriptive frame,\nand a document can then be represented as a bag of representative frames. We find that frame-based document representation not\nonly is more interpretable, but also can facilitate other text analysis tasks such as event tracking. We conduct comparative studies on\nthe effectiveness of SynRank, and show that the frame-based representation outperforms other methods on different applications on\nthree comparable news corpora."

These operations resolve the randomness issue in traditional label propagation algorithms (e.g., LPA), stabilizing the discovered communities in all runs of the same network. Tests on real-world networks demonstrate that LabelRank significantly improves the quality of detected communities compared to LPA, as well as other popular algorithms."

Due to the lack of structure support, a keyword query might generate an excessive number of matches, referred to as answer graphs, that could include different relationships among keywords. An ignored yet important task is to group and summarize answer graphs that share similar structures and contents for better query interpretation and\nresult understanding. This paper studies the summarization problem for the answer graphs induced by a keyword query Q. (1) A notion of summary graph is proposed to characterize the summarization of answer graphs. Given Q and a set of answer graphs G, a summary graph preserves the relation of the keywords in Q by summarizing the paths connecting the keywords nodes in G. (2) A quality metric of summary\ngraphs, called coverage ratio, is developed to measure information loss of summarization. (3) Based on the metric, a set of summarization problems are formulated, which aim to find minimized summary graphs with certain coverage ratio. (a) We show that the complexity of these summarization problems ranges from ptime to np-complete. (b) We provide exact and heuristic summarization algorithms. (4) Using real-life and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of our techniques. "

        "abstract": "There are two typical ways to acquire knowledge online: ask-\ning Google/browsing, or asking people. In a collaborative\nenvironment, it could be common that members look for\nsimilar information in order to gain knowledge in one do-\nmain. Rather than letting each member go through a simi-\nlar learning process (search the web, read, and search again),\nit is more desirable and productive for a member to learn\nfrom other members who have already gained the related\nknowledge through the Web.\nIn this paper, we investigate fine-grained knowledge shar-\ning in collaborative environments. Through analyzing a\nusers interactions with the Web, it is possible to detect dif-\nferent search and browsing tasks and find clues about the\nknowledge gained by such activities. We further decompose\neach task into fine-grained aspects. For example, a learning\nJava task might contain Java multi-thread programming\nas one aspect. We propose a two-step framework for min-\ning these aspects: (1) the Web surfing data is clustered into\ntasks by a nonparametric generative model; and (2) a dis-\ncriminative infinite Hidden Markov Model is developed to\nmine fine-grained aspects in each task. Finally, the clas-\nsic expert search method is applied to the mined results\nfor finding right advisors. Experiments on real Web surfing\ndata collected from our lab at UCSB and IBM show that\nthe task mining framework works as expected and achieves\nbetter performance than the baseline methods. When it is\nintegrated with expert search, the search accuracy improves\nby 11%, in comparison with the one using raw Web surfing\ndata."

        "abstract": "Overlay network topology together with peer/data organization and search algorithm are the crucial components of unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks as they directly affect the efficiency of search on such networks. Scale-free (powerlaw) overlay network topologies are among structures that offer high performance for these networks. A key problem for these topologies is the existence of hubs, nodes with high connectivity. Yet, the peers in a typical unstructured P2P network may not be willing or able to cope with such high connectivity and its associated load. Therefore, some hard cutoffs are often imposed on the number of edges that each peer can have, restricting feasible overlays to limited or truncated scale-free networks. In this paper, we analyze the growth of such limited scale-free networks and propose two different algorithms for constructing perfect scale-free overlay network topologies at each instance of such growth. Our algorithms allow the user to define the desired scale-free exponent (gamma). They also induce low communication overhead when network grows from one size to another. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that these algorithms indeed generate perfect scale free networks (at each step of network growth) that provide better search efficiency in various search algorithms than the networks generated by the existing solutions.

        "abstract": "Map matching refers to the problem of determining which\nroad (in a map) a vehicle is on using data from sensors (such\nas GPS, cell tower triangulation, WiFi localization). Hidden\nMarkov Models (HMMs) based map matching  that\nmatches a sequence of location samples to a road network\n has received a lot of traction in recent years. In this paper\nwe revisit the basic assumption underlying HMM-based map\nmatching algorithms, namely, the hypothesis that the true\nmobility is Markovian. We use the Chapman-Kolmogorov\ntest and argue that mobility is non-Markovian (especially\nwhen the moving object has an intent to reach a specific destination)\nusing thousands of real taxicab mobility datasets\nspanning several weeks. Indeed in most cases users may\nprefer the shortest/fastest path whose statistical properties\nare fundamentally different from that of a Markovian random\nwalker. Based on these observations we present an\nalternate approach to the map matching problem that relies\nexclusively on shortest path computations, which are at\nmost linear in the number of road segments, and thus avoids\nexpensive complexity of HMM-based map matching algorithms\n(e.g., using a Viterbi decoder). We present extensive\nexperimental results to show that our approach vastly outperforms\nHMM-based approaches in terms of both computational\ncomplexity and accuracy."

Recently, we found long-term correlations in the users activity in social communities. Here, we extend this work to study the collective behavior of the whole community with the goal of understanding the origin of clustering and long-term persistence. At the individual level, we find that the correlations in activity are a byproduct of the clustering expressed in the power-law distribution of inter-event times of single users, i.e. short periods of many events are separated by long periods of no events. On the contrary, the activity of the whole community presents long-term correlations that are a true emergent property of the system, i.e. they are not related to the distribution of inter-event times. This result suggests the existence of collective behavior, possibly arising from nontrivial communication patterns through the embedding social network."

        "abstract": "In distributed network environments, decisions must often be made based on incomplete or uncertain evidence whose sources may be dependent. Properly fusing potentially unreliable and dependent information from multiple sources is critical to effective decision making. The Transferable Belief Model (TBM), an extension of Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST), is a well known information fusion framework that can cope with conflicting evidences. However, neither DST nor TBM deals with misbehaving data sources and dependence of fusion data, which are often observed in dynamic multi-hop network environments. In this work, we propose a decision fusion framework that considers multi-dimensional trust and independence of information using a provenance technique, to enhance fusion reliability. We consider three information trust dimensions: correctness, completeness, and timeliness. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework yields a higher correct decision ratio, compared with the baseline counterparts. "

        "abstract": "With the proliferation of sensor-embedded mobile computing devices, participatory sensing is becoming popular to collect information from and outsource tasks to participating users. These applications deal with a lot of personal information, e.g., users' identities and locations at a specific time. Therefore, we need to pay a deeper attention to privacy and anonymity. However, from a data consumer's point of view, we want to know the source of the sensing data, i.e., the identity of the sender, in order to evaluate how much the data can be trusted. *Anonymity* and *trust* are two conflicting objectives in participatory sensing networks, and there are no existing research efforts which investigated the possibility of achieving both of them at the same time. In this paper, we propose ARTSense, a framework to solve the problem of *trust without identity* in participatory sensing networks. Our solution consists of a privacy-preserving provenance model, a data trust assessment scheme and an anonymous reputation management protocol. We have shown that ARTSense achieves the anonymity and security requirements. Validations are done to show that we can capture the trust of information and reputation of participants accurately."

        "abstract": "Location-based services are quickly becoming immensely popular. In addition to services based on users' current location, many potential services rely on users' location history, or their spatial-temporal provenance. Malicious users may lie about their spatial-temporal provenance without a carefully designed security system for users to prove their past locations. In this paper, we present the Spatial-Temporal provenance Assurance with Mutual Proofs (STAMP) scheme. In contrast to most existing location proof systems which rely on infrastructure like wireless APs, STAMP is based on co-located mobile devices mutually generating location proofs for each other. This makes STAMP desirable for a wider range of applications. STAMP ensures the integrity and non-transferability of the location proofs and protects users' privacy. We also examine different collusion scenarios and propose a light-weight entropy-based trust evaluation approach to detect fake proofs resulting from collusion attacks. Our prototype implementation on the Android platform shows that STAMP is low-cost in terms of computational and storage resources. Extensive simulation experiments show that our entropy-based trust model is able to achieve high (>0.9) collusion detection accuracy."

        "abstract": "Entities in a communication network may use various types of collaborative networking for sharing information. The derivation history (i.e., the provenance) of the information plays very important roles in such a networking environment, such as information trustworthiness assessment, copyright clearance, data reconciliation, and data replication. While substantial research efforts have focused on these usages of provenance, very limited work has focused on the security issues of the provenance, which is the prerequisite of the provenance usages. In this paper, we explore the security properties of data provenance in a distributed network environment. We introduce the Public-key Linked Chain (PKLC) provenance scheme to provide security assurance for data provenance in three dimensions - confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our *chain-structure* PKLC scheme outperforms the previously proposed ``onion-structure'' provenance security scheme in terms of the flexibility, protection capability as well as computational overhead. We also introduce the Loop Dropping Attack, a specific type of provenance dropping attack that is particularly challenging to defend against in a distributed information network. On top of PKLC, we propose a Loop Dropping Verification Protocol (LDVP) to mitigate the Loop Dropping Attack. Experimental results show that our PKLC framework reduces computational overhead (particularly verification overhead) significantly compared with the Onion scheme."

These results suggest that our algorithm could potentially reduce false positive rates in existing anomaly detection systems."

        "abstract": "Past literature [1] has shown that problems involving tacit communication among humans and agents are better solved by identifying communication focal points based on domain specific human biases. Cast differently, classification of user-generated content into generalized categories is the equivalent of automated programs trying to match human adjudged labels. It seems logical to suspect that identification and incorporation of features generally found salient by humans or focal points, can allow an automated agent to better match human adjudged labels in classification tasks. In this paper, we leverage this correspondence, by using domain-specific focal points to further inform the classification algorithms of the inherent human biases. We empirically evaluate our method, by classifying YouTube videos using user-annotated tags. Improvements in classification accuracy over the state-of-the-art classification techniques on using our transformed (using focal points) and highly reduced feature space reveals the value of the approach in subjective classification tasks."

        "abstract": "Many real-world social interactions involve multiple people, for e.g., authors collaborating on a paper, email exchanges made in a company and task-oriented teams in workforce. Simple graph representation of these activities destroys the group structure present in them. Hypergraphs have recently emerged as a better tool for modeling group interactions. However, methods in social hypernetwork analysis havent kept pace. In this work, we extend the concept of node degree centrality to hypergraphs. We validate our proposed measures using alternate measures of influence available to us using two datasets namely, the DBLP dataset of scientific collaborations and the group network in a popular Chinese multi-player online game called CR3. We discuss several schemes for assigning weights to hyperedges and compare them empirically. Finally, we define separate weak and strong tie node degree centralities which improves performance of our models. Weak tie degree centrality is found to be a better predictor of influence in hypergraphs than strong\ntie degree centrality. "

The high mobility of nodes in a MANET constantly causes the network topology to change. Mobility patterns of nodes have a direct effect on fundamental network characteristics like path length, neighborhood size, and link stability. Consequently the network performance is strongly affected by the nature of mobility patterns. While evaluating protocols for a specific MANET application, it becomes imperative to use a mobility model that is able to capture the movement of nodes in an accurate manner. The objective of this work is to produce mobility models that are able to describe tactical mobility in military applications of MANETs. We provide models of four tactical scenarios, show that these models are accurate compared to synthetic traces, and that when used to evaluate network protocols, provide different conclusions that when using generic mobility models."

The\nfrequently used method for detecting user contact is through\nBluetooth on smartphones. However, Bluetooth scans consume\nlots of power. Although increasing the scan duty cycle can\nreduce the power consumption, it also reduces the accuracy of\ncontact detection. In this paper, we address this problem based\non the observation that user contact changes (i.e., starts and\nends of user contacts) are mainly caused by user movement.\nSince most smartphones have accelerometers, we can use them\nto detect user movement with much less energy and then\nstart Bluetooth scans to detect user contacts. By conducting\nexperiments on smartphones, we discover three relationships\nbetween user movement and user contact changes. According\nto these relationships, we propose a Mobility-Assisted User\nContact detection algorithm (MAUC), which triggers Bluetooth\nscans only when user movements have a high possibility to\ncause contact changes. Moreover, we propose energy aware\nMAUC (E-MAUC) to further reduce energy consumption\nduring Bluetooth discovery, while keeping the same detection\naccuracy as MAUC. Via trace driven simulations, we show\nthat MAUC can reduce the number of Bluetooth scans by half\nwhile maintaining similar contact detection rates compared\nto existing algorithms, and E-MAUC can further reduce the\nenergy consumption by 45% compared to MAUC."

However they become  ineffective when applied to short texts such as Twitter feeds where not enough context evidence is presented. %Adapting these NLP tools to short texts becomes a pressing need due to the pervasive presence of social media data such as Twitter messages.  \nTo overcome the data sparseness issue, we propose a solution in which a newswire document related to a given tweet is selected to provide contextual support for NLP tasks. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1. we introduce the Linking-Tweets-to-News task as well as a dataset of linked tweet-news pairs, which can benefit many NLP applications; 2. In contrast to previous research which focuses on lexical features within the short texts (text-to-word information), we propose a latent variable model WTMF-G (weighted textual matrix factorization on graphs) that models the inter short text correlations (text-to-text information).  We show that using the tweet specific feature (hashtag) and news specific feature (named entities) as well as the temporal constraints, we are able to extract text-to-text correlations, and thus model quality latent vectors for tweets and news.  Our experiments show significant improvement of WTMF-G over baselines for three evaluation metrics in the new task.\n"

We use human-edited web page directories to infer categories from URLs contained in tweets.

We envision this capa- bility being driven by similarity-based queries posed to a cloud search front-end, which in turn dynamically retrieves media objects from mobile devices that best match the respective queries within a given time limit. Building upon a crowd-sensing framework, we have designed and implemented a system called MediaScope that provides this capability. MediaScope is an extensible framework that supports nearest-neighbor and other geometric queries on the feature space (e.g., clusters, spanners), and contains novel retrieval algorithms that attempt to maximize the retrieval of relevant infor- mation. From experiments on a prototype, MediaScope is shown to achieve near-optimal query completeness and low to moderate overhead on mobile devices."

QoI is a recently introduced composite metric which is impacted by a number of attributes of information communicated from the source(s) to the destination(s), and as such differs from traditional quality-of-service metrics considered to date. The focus of this work is defining the Operational Information Content Sum Capacity (OICC-S) of a network, achieved by the set of QoI-vectors supported which maximize sum utility of the network. This utility is defined as a function of the QoI attributes provided by the source input, as well as the channel induced attributes that impact the QoI delivered to the destination(s). Optimum rate allocation to maximize the output sum utility and achieve OICC-S of the network for various settings is provided, and demonstrated to differ from the solution that provides maximum throughput, making QoI-awareness necessary in resource allocation. Insights arising from the analysis are provided, along with those from practical scenarios."

        "abstract": "The continued explosion of Twitter data has opened doors for many ubiquitous applications, such as location-based advertisement and entertainment using smartphones. Unfortunately, only about 0.58 percent of tweets are geo-tagged to date. To tackle the location sparseness problem, this pa- per presents a methodical approach to predicting the fine- grained location of each tweet. First, we build probabilistic models for locations using unstructured short messages tightly coupled with semantic locations. Second, we propose text analysis techniques to filter out those location-neutral tweets, which may not be related to any location at all. Third, we utilize ranking techniques to select the best candidate location for a tweet. Finally, we develop a classification- based prediction validation method to classify the location of where the tweet was actually written. We conduct extensive experiments using tweets covering three months and our results show that our approach can significantly increase the percentage of geo-tagged tweets with high accuracy."

        "abstract": "Collective intelligence, which aggregates the shared information\nfrom large crowds, is often negatively impacted by unreliable infor-\nmation sources with the low quality data. This becomes a barrier\nto the effective use of collective intelligence in a variety of appli-\ncations. In order to address this issue, we propose a probabilistic\nmodel to jointly assess the reliability of sources and find the true\ndata. We observe that different sources are often not independent\nof each other. Instead, sources are prone to be mutually influenced,\nwhich makes them dependent when sharing information with each\nother. High dependency between sources makes collective intelli-\ngence vulnerable to the overuse of redundant (and possibly incor-\nrect) information from the dependent sources. Thus, we reveal the\nlatent group structure among dependent sources, and aggregate the\ninformation at the group level rather than from individual sources\ndirectly. This can prevent the collective intelligence from being\ninappropriately dominated by dependent sources. We will also ex-\nplicitly reveal the reliability of groups, and minimize the negative\nimpacts of unreliable groups. Experimental results on real-world\ndata sets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with re-\nspect to existing algorithms."

The differential stream classification\nproblem can also be considered a general form of  the node-centric\nevent detection problem, in which node labels are used in order to\nsupervise the detection process.

        "abstract": "Video uploads and transfers using smartphones are becoming increasingly\npopular. To prevent the interception of content from eavesdroppers, video\nflows need to be encrypted. However, encryption results in an associated\ncost in terms of processing delays and energy consumed on the user's device.\nIn lieu of encrypting the entire video flow to be transferred\nover a wireless link, we argue that encrypting only certain parts of the flow\ncan create sufficiently high distortion at an eavesdropper and can thus preserve\nthe confidentiality of the content. By not encrypting all the packets in\na video flow, one can conceivably reduce the end to end delay and the battery\nconsumption on the mobile device. The question that we seek to answer then is\n``Can we only encrypt parts of a video flow towards reducing consequential\nperformance penalties and yet preserve the confidentiality of the flow,\nand if so, what parts of the flow should be encrypted?''\nTowards answering this question, we develop a mathematical framework that\ncaptures the impact of the encryption process\non the delay experienced by a flow, and the distortion seen by an eavesdropper.\nSpecifically, our model accounts for both the wireless characteristics\n(packet losses) and the type of video (slow versus fast motion).\nIt provides a quick and efficient way of determining the right\nparts of video traffic that needs to be encrypted to preserve\nconfidentiality, while limiting performance penalties. We\nvalidate our model via extensive experiments using Android smartphones\nand with different encryption policies.\nWe observe that by encrypting only selective parts of a video flow\none can preserve the confidentiality while reducing\nthe delay by as much as 75% and the energy consumption by as much as 92%."

For example, a link which connects\nnodes from different communities may affect the group assignment of nodes in a negative way. In this paper, we study a new problem called link selection, which can be seen as the network equivalent of the traditional feature selection problem in machine learning. More\nspecifically, we investigate unsupervised link selection as follows: given a network, it selects a subset of informative links from the\noriginal network which enhance the quality of community structures. To achieve this goal, we use Ratio Cut size of a network as the\nquality measure. The resulting link selection approach can be formulated as a semi-definite programming problem. In order to solve it\nefficiently, we propose a backward elimination algorithm using sequential optimization. Experiments on benchmark network datasets\nillustrate the effectiveness of our method."

Here we report a series of generic relationships between the quantities characterizing these two areas by demonstrating that the degree and link weight distributions in social networks can be expressed in terms of the dynamical exponents characterizing human activity patterns.

The considered description offers a general and unified framework, in which previously proposed mobility models like the gravity model, the intervening opportunities model, and the recently introduced radiation model are naturally resulting as special cases. A new form of radiation model is derived and its validity is investigated using observational data offered by commuting trips obtained from the United States census data set, and the mobility fluxes extracted from mobile phone data collected in a western European country. The new modeling paradigm offered by this description suggests that the complex topological features observed in large mobility and transportation networks may be the result of a simple stochastic process taking place on an inhomogeneous landscape."

        "abstract": "Modeling trust in very large social networks is a hard problem due to the highly noisy nature of these networks that span trust relationships from many different contexts, based on judgments of reliability, dependability and competence and the relationships vary in their level of strength. In this paper, we introduce a new extended balance theory as a foundational theory of trust in networks. Our theory preserves the distinctions between trust and distrust as suggested in the literature, but also incorporates the notion of relationship strength which can be expressed as either discrete categorical values, as pairwise comparisons or as metric distances. Our model is novel, has sound social and psychological basis, and captures the classical balance theory as a special case. We then propose a convergence model, describing how an imbalanced network evolves towards new balance and formulate the convergence problem of a social network as a Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) optimiza- tion problem. Finally, we show how the convergence model can be used to predict edge signs in social networks, and justify our theory through experiments on real datasets."

The groups in question were teams in a multi-team system (MTS) conducting a simulated convoy escort task in an online game environment.  The experiment manipulated communication network configuration and trust between the two teams in the multi-team system. It employed a 2 (completely-connected/ chain network) X 2 (high trust/low trust) design. Results indicated that the trust manipulation was successful and that most of the MTSs conformed to the network manipulations. However, a number of MTSs in the completely-connected condition reverted \nto a chain structure, reflecting the adaptability of team members. Results indicated no \ndifferences due to the manipulations. Relatively large within-cell variance suggests that \nmediating and moderating effects due to group processes may impact input-output \nrelationships. Implications and plans for future research are discussed. "

Despite this interest in understanding the process underlying the unfolding of relationships in small groups, current theoretical and operational formulations of team process need greater specification if they are to truly afford a high-resolution view of team dynamics. Groups researchers interested in time study process as either a snapshot, or as a limited series of snapshots, rather than as a continuous movie displaying the nuanced sequential interactions commencing among various subsets of team members. Given the increasing availability of rich streams of trace markers about team dynamics, corresponding advances are needed in conceptual and analytic frameworks to enable these digital traces to be brought to bear on the understanding of team dynamics.

For example in social or communication networks, diseases or intrusions usually do not propagate uniformly, which makes it critical to find anomalous regions with high concentrations of a specific disease or intrusion. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model to identify anomalous subgraphs containing a significantly different percentage of a certain vertex attribute, such as a specific disease or an intrusion, compared to the rest of the graph. Our framework, gAnomaly, models generative processes of vertex attributes and divides the graph into regions that are governed by background and anomaly processes. Two types of regularizers are employed to smoothen the regions and to facilitate vertex assignment. We utilize deterministic annealing EM to learn the model parameters, which is less initialization-dependent and better at avoiding local optima. In order to find fine-grained anomalies, an iterative procedure is further proposed. Experiments show gAnomaly outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm at uncovering anomalous subgraphs in attributed graphs. structural and attribute information, while avoiding an artificially designed anomaly measure. Experiments on both synthetic and realata show gAnomaly outperforms the state-of-art algorithm at uncovering anomalous attributed patterns."

        "abstract": "Named entity disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentions in natural language text to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base such as Wikipedia. Such disambiguation can help enhance readability and add semantics to plain text. It is also a central step in constructing high-quality information network or knowledge graph from unstructured text. Previous research has tackled this problem by making use of various textual and structural features from a knowledge base. Most of the proposed algorithms assume that a knowledge base can provide enough explicit and useful information to help disambiguate a mention to the right entity. However, the existing knowledge bases are rarely complete (likely will never be), thus leading to poor performance on short queries with not well-known contexts.\nIn such cases, we need to collect additional evidences scattered in internal and external corpus to augment the knowledge bases and enhance their disambiguation power. In this work, we propose a generative model and an incremental algorithm to automatically mine useful evidences across documents. With a specific modeling of background topic and unknown entities, our model is able to harvest useful evidences without introducing noisy information. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly: boosting the disambiguation accuracy from 43% (baseline) to 86% on short queries derived from tweets."

This problem has applications to capacity planning, network theory, among other areas. Examples of real-world applications include characterizing in-degree distributions in large graphs and uncovering TCP/IP flow size distributions on the Internet. We demonstrate that it is hard to estimate the original set size distribution. The recoverability of original set size distributions presents a sharp threshold with respect to the fraction of elements that remain in the sets. If this fraction remains below a threshold, typically half of the elements in power-law and heavier-than-exponential-tailed distributions, then the original set size distribution is unrecoverable. We also discuss practical implications of our findings. "

To this end, we introduce two new measures of centrality, both based on communities in the network: local and community centrality. Community centrality is a novel concept that we introduce to describe how central ones community is within the whole network. We introduce an algorithm to estimate the distance between communities and use it to find the centrality of communities. Using data from several social networks, we show that community centrality is able to capture the importance of communities in the whole network. We then conduct a detailed study of different social networks and determine how various global measures of prominence relate to structural centrality measures. We also study how the importance of local and global information changes for different segments of the data. Our measures deconstruct global centrality along local and community dimensions. In some cases, prominence is determined almost exclusively by local information, while in others a mix of local and community centrality matter. Our methodology is a step toward an understanding of the processes that contribute to an actors prominence in a network."

        "abstract": "Competition among agents arise in a host of economic, biological, and social dynamic systems. Agents can be products, chemical elements, cities, or scholarly papers that compete for resources such as customers, chemical bounds, people, or citations, that are frequently uniquely assigned to an agent. The idea behind Cumulative Advantage (CA) models (with fitness) is simple: a unit of wealth that arrives in the system is assigned to an agent with probability proportional to the wealth of the agent and a fitness parameter.\nThe CA model has been formally investigated since the 1920s (Po lya and Eggenberger, 1923) and shown over the years to exhibit various features found in real world competitions, most prominently power law distributions of wealth. Recent mathematical results (Antal et al., 2010) shed light into the dynamics of such competition, characterizing the time until two agents first tie. It is also known that the average number of ties of an ensemble of agents grows as a function of the total wealth (Godreche et al., 2010). Our work tackles two fundamental questions regarding pairwise competitions that cannot be addressed using existing results:\n(a) how long does it take for an undisputed leader to emerge?\n(b) how many times do agents tie during this competition?\nWe provide closed form approximations and numerical simulations that characterize the distribution of the time of the last tie and the distribution of the number of ties. Note that the former captures the duration of the tussle while the later captures the intensity of the tussle. We investigate these statistics in the cases that agents are equally fit and not."

We study the threshold model with\nuniformly distributed threshold $\\\\phi$ triggered by multiple initiators, in the context of opinion formation on Erdos-Renyi random graphs, an empirical social network, and various artificially constructed networks topologies. We discuss different strategies of\nselecting a fraction $p$ of initiator nodes to obtain a large and efficient spread of opinion. Spread can be restricted by an\nindividual's high threshold and if the threshold is sufficiently high, spread becomes impossible. However, we find that for an\narbitrary high threshold, there exists a critical fraction p_c of initiators (unique for a given threshold) that is needed to\ntrigger the spreading process. Network structure, in particular local clustering, plays an important role in this scenario. Similar\nto the case of single-node or single-clique initiators, we observed that locally well-connected clusters facilitate the opinion spread\nas opposed to a homogeneous random network."

        "abstract": "Ensemble learning has emerged as a powerful method for combining multiple models. Well-known methods, such as\nbagging, boosting, and model averaging, have been shown to improve accuracy and robustness over single models. However, due to\nthe high costs of manual labeling, it is hard to obtain sufficient and reliable labeled data for effective training. Meanwhile, lots of\nunlabeled data exist in these sources, and we can readily obtain multiple unsupervised models. Although unsupervised models do not\ndirectly generate a class label prediction for each object, they provide useful constraints on the joint predictions for a set of related\nobjects. Therefore, incorporating these unsupervised models into the ensemble of supervised models can lead to better prediction\nperformance. In this paper, we study ensemble learning with outputs from multiple supervised and unsupervised models, a topic where\nlittle work has been done. We propose to consolidate a classification solution by maximizing the consensus among both supervised\npredictions and unsupervised constraints. We cast this ensemble task as an optimization problem on a bipartite graph, where the\nobjective function favors the smoothness of the predictions over the graph, but penalizes the deviations from the initial labeling\nprovided by the supervised models. We solve this problem through iterative propagation of probability estimates among neighboring\nnodes and prove the optimality of the solution. The proposed method can be interpreted as conducting a constrained embedding in a\ntransformed space, or a ranking on the graph. Experimental results on different applications with heterogeneous data sources\ndemonstrate the benefits of the proposed method over existing alternatives"

However, as graph data grows in scale, it becomes increasingly more challenging to identify clusters. In this paper we propose\nan efficient clustering algorithm for large scale graph data using spectral methods. The key idea is to repeatedly generate a small number of supernodes connected to the regular nodes, in order to compress the original graph into a sparse bipartite graph. By clustering the bipartite graph using spectral methods, we are able to greatly improve efficiency without losing considerable clustering power.

We show that nontrivial research insight can be obtained from such analysis, including (1) ranking, clustering, classification and similarity search of researchers, terms and venues for research subfields and themes, (2) recommending good researchers and good research papers to read or cite when conducting research on certain topics, (3) predicting potential collaborators for certain theme-oriented research, and (4) predicting advisor-advisee relationships and affiliation history based on historical research publications. Although some of these functions have been studied in recent research, effective and scalable realization of such functions in large networks still poses challenging research problems. Moreover, some function are our on-\ngoing research tasks.

As the body of medical literature expands rapidly, keeping this knowledge up-to-date becomes a challenge for medical professionals. One question is that for a given disease how can we find the most influential treatments currently available from online medical publications? In this paper we propose MedRank, a new network-based algorithm that ranks heterogeneous objects in a medical information network. The network is extracted from MEDLINE, a large collection of semi-structured medical literature. Different types of objects such as journal articles, pathological symptoms, diseases, clinical trials, treatments, authors, and journals are linked together through their relationships. The experimental results are compared with the expert rankings collected from doctors and two baseline methods, namely degree centrality and NetClus. The evaluation shows that our algorithm is effective and efficient.  The success of categorized entity ranking in medical literature domain suggests a new methodology and a potential success in ranking semi-structured data in other domains."

This question captures the essence of the problem we address here. We study the intertwined propagation of two competing memes (or data, rumors, etc.) in a composite network. A key novelty is our use of a compos- ite network, which we define as a single set of nodes with two distinct types of edges interconnecting them. We address two questions: (a) which meme will prevail? and (b) how can we control the outcome of the propagation? First, we model our system with a modified susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) propagation mechanism. Second, we analyze the problem using a Non-Linear Dynamic System (NLDS) and eigenvalue analysis and identify the tipping point of the epidemic behavior. Third, we propose a method we call EigenPredictor, which proves to be an effective and accurate in pre- dicting viral dominance. Furthermore, we design and evaluate suppression techniques for altering the outcome of such competition. The accuracy and effectiveness of our methods are validated against both real and synthetic composite networks, including a real enterprise network of calls and text messages. Finally, we evaluate the effect of cross-contamination across various graphs. Our work is among the first to study the interplay between two competing memes in composite networks."

The resulting algorithms are simple and suitable for distributed implementation. The admission control decisions involve each user choosing the quality of the video chunk asked for download, based on the network congestion in its neighborhood. This form of admission control is compatible with the current video streaming technology based on the DASH protocol over TCP connections. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the algorithm for a large system and derive empirical bounds for the number of video chunks that should be pre-fetched in order to guarantee smooth playback without interruptions.

        "abstract": "Social media is rapidly becoming an integral part of modern society. People use social media as a channel of communications with each other, a targeted group or a general public. Concurrently, researchers are studying this channel of communications in an attempt to link the characteristics of the message, such as content, sender-receiver, etc. to the behavior of those using this media. The focus of the research reported herein is to analyze human behavior in response to actionable information in the context of an extreme event. A specific case of actionable information presented in this paper is recommendations to take actions to reduce the chance of harm from the consequences of an extreme event i.e. an alert or warning. Authorized officials via multiple channels of communication issue the warnings to the public. At present, social media is not used universally as an official channel of communication. There is still no clear consensus among emergency management organizations on how the social media can be utilized to disseminate warnings to the public. The first step is to understand peoples behaviors on social media in response to actionable information during extreme events. In order to understand peoples behaviors on social media, we need to understand the content of their messages and how the messages travel through social media. The paper focuses on identifying hidden key actors (individual/organizations) using advanced social network analysis techniques. Additionally, the paper examines the formation of the cohesive groups in the network and the role of the key actors in those groups. Our conclusion is that the key actors play an important role in diffusion of actionable information. The diffusion begins with central and prominent actors and diffuses through the gatekeepers of information to the rest of the network. The key actors exhibit intentions to take a prescribed action and urge others to do so. Finally, the key actors play in important role of bridging cohesive groups in the network in order to facilitate the diffusion of actionable information. "

During disaster events it is imperative for people in affected areas to obtain accurate information. People using social media make a conscious decision to both trust and act on or to propagate the information obtained or to disregard it. However, local government in general, has not developed agreed upon ways to use social media in emergencies. This study documents how emergency management was able to successfully partner with a local media and utilize social media to develop a viable relationship with the community via social media in emergencies.

These processes, more patently the Galton-Watson process, are widely used to model biological, social, cognitive, and technological phenomena, such as the diffusion of ideas, knowledge, chain letters, viruses, and the evolution of humans through their Y-chromosome DNA or mitochondrial RNA. A practical challenge of modeling real phenomena using a Galton-Watson process is the offspring distribution, which must be measured from the population. In most cases, however, directly measuring the offspring distribution is unrealistic due to lack of resources or the death of agents. So far, researchers have relied on informed guesses to guide their choice of offspring distribution. In this work we propose a collection of methods to estimate the offspring distribution from real sampled data. Using a small sampled fraction of the agents and instrumented with the identity of the ancestors of the sampled agents, we show that accurate offspring distribution estimates can be obtained by sampling as little as 14% of the population.

For example, testing the effects of network configurations like a small-world topology on an iterated public goods game requires networks to have dozens of participants for each group observation, which would quickly exhaust traditional participant pools and experimenters patience.

The ability to balance between fairness and efficiency depend, among other things, on information regarding the mutual accountability for the outcomes of the interaction. In this paper we examine how information regarding mutual interdependencies influence the interplay between fairness and efficiency in repeated Chicken Game. We distinguish between three possible types of fair behavior: mutual cooperation, alternating cooperation and mutual destruction. Our results show that the first two types of fairness are positively correlated with the availability of social information. In contrast, mutual destructive fairness is not sensitive to the availability of information and is avoided in general. We also find that without information regarding mutual interdependencies unfairness increases in parallel with efficiency. However when social information is available, increase in fairness is coupled with a decrease in efficiency, and the best compromise between fairness and efficiency is reached when the mutual interdependencies are learned through repeated experiences. We highlight the significance of our results for fair and efficient interaction in repeated social interactions."

In this paper, we use a computational model based upon Instance-based Learning Theory (IBLT) and use it to study hypotheses on how participants may integrate descriptive and experiential information presented in a repeated prisoners dilemma. Two players, each simulated by an Instanced-based Learning (IBL) model, play against each other in a repeated prisoners dilemma. They are provided with a descriptive payoff matrix as well as the experiential information in the form of each others payoffs after making repeated decisions. Our results demonstrate that the descriptive payoff matrix information is incorporated into decisions using two mechanisms. The first is expectations derived from the description. While a second mechanism, highlights the immediate and worst possible outcomes in the description, giving them more attention compared to other possible outcomes. We highlight the significance of our results for decision making in social dilemmas."

In life, however, we rarely have full information. Research shows that the absence or presence of interdependence information decreases or increases cooperation in a repeated Prisoners Dilemma (PD). We use an instance-based learning (IBL) cognitive model to account for the dynamics of cooperation observed with differing interdependency information. The model accurately predicts cooperation dynamics when players have minimal or no information. We test three hypotheses about how a player accounts for the partners outcomes when they are explicitly given. Best predictions come from a model that weighs a partners outcome dynamically, as a function of surprise. Surprise decreases gradually through interaction with the same partner, resulting in more accurate predictions of the partner's actions. We explain how the IBL model captures such behavior and discuss the implications for improving cooperation more broadly."

        "abstract": "This paper presents a streaming approach to solve the truth estimation problem in crowdsourcing applications. We consider a category of crowdsourcing applications where a group of individuals volunteer (or are recruited to) share certain observations or measurements about the physical world. Examples include reporting locations of gas stations that remain operational after a natural disaster or reporting locations of potholes on city streets. We call such applications social sensing. Ascertaining the correctness of reported observations is a key challenge in such applications, referred to as the truth estimation problem. This problem is made difficult by the fact that the reliability of individual sources is usually unknown a priori, since any concerned citizen may, in principle, participate. Moreover, the timescales of crowdsourcing campaigns of interest can be as small as a few hours or days, which does not offer enough history for a reputation system to converge. Instead, recent prior work, including our own, developed fact-finding algorithms to solve this problem by iteratively assessing the credibility of sources and their claims in the absence of reputation scores. Such algorithms, however, operate on the entire dataset of reported observations in a batch fashion, which makes them less suited to applications where new observations arrive continually. In this paper, we describe a streaming fact-finder that recursively updates previous estimates based on new data. The recursive algorithm solves an expectation maximization (EM) problem to determine the odds of correctness of different observations. We compare the performance of our recursive EM algorithm to a batch EM algorithm, as well as to several state-of-art fact-finders through extensive simulations. We also demonstrate convergence of the recursive algorithm to the results of the batch version through a real social sensing experiment. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach can process data streams much more efficiently while keeping the truth estimation accuracy close to that of the (much slower) batch algorithm. Ours is therefore the first fact-finder developed with explicit consideration to the continuous update needs of crowd-sourcing applications.\n"

        "abstract": "The explosive growth in social network content suggests that the largest sensor network yet might be human. Extending the participatory sensing model, this paper explores the prospect of utilizing social networks as sensor networks, which gives rise to an interesting reliable sensing problem. In this problem, individuals are represented by sensors (data sources) who occasionally make observations about the physical world. These observations may be true or false, and hence are viewed as binary claims. The reliable sensing problem is to determine the correctness of reported observations. From a networked sensing standpoint, what makes this sensing problem formulation different is that, in the case of human participants, not only is the reliability of sources usually unknown but also the original data provenance may be uncertain. Individuals may report observations made by others as their own. The contribution of this paper lies in developing a model that considers the impact of such information sharing on the analytical foundations of reliable sensing, and embed it into a tool called Apollo that uses Twitter as a sensor network for observing events in the physical world. Evaluation, using Twitter-based case-studies, shows good correspondence between observations deemed correct by Apollo and ground truth."

A bounty of examples exists in diverse network genres: botnet communication growth, moving traffic jams, information foraging in document networks (WWW and Wikipedia), and spread of viral memes or opinions in social networks. The network structure in all the above examples remains relatively fixed, while the shape, size and position of the affected network regions change gradually with time. Traffic jams grow, move, shrink and eventually disappear. Public attention shifts among current hot topics inducing a similar shift of highly accessed Wikipedia articles. Discovery of such smoothly evolving network processes has the potential to expose the intrinsic mechanisms of complex network dynamics, enable new data-driven models and improve network design.\n\nWe introduce the novel problem of Mining smoothly evolving processes (MINE SMOOTH) in networks with dynamic real-valued node/edge weights. We show that ensuring smooth transitions in the solution is NP-hard even on restricted network structures such as trees. We propose an efficient filtering-based framework, called LEGATO. It achieves 37 times improvement in the obtained process scores (i.e. larger and stronger-impact processes) compared to alternatives on real networks, and above 80% accuracy in discovering realistic embedded processes in synthetic networks. In transportation networks, LEGATO discovers processes that conform to existing theoretical models for traffic jams, while its obtained processes in Wikipedia reveal the temporal evolution of information seeking of Internet users."

The application of the theory hinges on the use of a rule for combining evidence from different sources.

Here we describe several of these rules as argument schemes, using critical questions to capture the assumptions behind the rules. An example illustrates how we imagine these argument schemes might be used."

        "abstract": "Recent advances on the Web have generated unprecedented opportunities for individuals around the world to assemble into teams. And yet, because of the Web, the nature of teams and how they are assembled has changed radically. Today, many teams are ad hoc, agile, distributed, transient entities that are assembled from a larger primordial network of relationships within virtual communities. These assemblages possess the potential to unleash the high levels of creativity and innovation necessary for productively addressing many of the daunting challenges confronting contemporary society. This article argues that Web science is particularly well suited to help us realize this potential by making a substantial interdisciplinary intellectual investment in (i) advancing theories that explain our socio-technical motivations to form teams, (ii) the development of new analytic methods and models to untangle the unique influences of these motivations on team assembly, (iii) harvesting, curating and leveraging the digital trace data offered by the Web to test our models, and (iv) implementing recommender systems that use insights gleaned from our richer theoretical understanding of the motivations that lead to effective team assembly."

There is a need for algorithms that can incrementally update and monitor communities whose evolution generates huge real-time data streams, such as the Internet or on-line social networks. In this paper, we propose LabelRankT, an on-line distributed algorithm for detection of communities in large-scale dynamic networks through stabilized label propagation. Results of tests on real-world networks demonstrate that LabelRankT has much lower computational costs than other algorithms. It also improves the quality of the detected communities compared to dynamic detection methods and matches the quality achieved by static detection approaches. Unlike most of other algorithms which apply only to binary networks, LabelRankT works on weighted and directed networks, which provides a flexible and promising solution for real-world applications."

        "abstract": "A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical (i.e., sensor) devices with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a context sensitive system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in real-world situations. The CPS has wide applications in scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is called *mining lines in the sand*. With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a designated area, the CPS is required to discover all the\ntrajectories (lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy; (2) the intruders do not send out any identification information, the system needs to distinguish multiple intruders and track their movements. In this study, we propose a method called LiSM (Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover the trajectories from untrustworthy sensor data. LiSM constructs a watching network from sensor data and computes the locations of\nintruder appearances based on the link information of the network. The system retrieves a cone-model from the historical trajectories and tracks multiple intruders based on this model. Finally the system validates the mining results and updates the sensor's reliability in a feedback process.  Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods."

Moreover, such data are often linked together (e.g., structured specification of products linking with the corresponding product descriptions and customer comments). Even for text data such as news data, typed entities can be extracted with entity extraction tools. The EventCube project constructs TextCube and\nTopicCube from interconnected structured and text data (or from text data via entity extraction and dimension building), and performs multidimensional search and analysis on such datasets, in an informative, powerful, and user-friendly manner. This proposed EventCube demo will show the power of the system not only on the originally designed ASRS (Aviation Safety Report System) data sets, but also on news datasets, collected from multiple news agencies.  The system has high potential to be extended in many powerful ways and serve as a general platform for search, OLAP (online analytical processing) and data mining on integrated\ntext and structured data. After the system demo in the conference (if accepted), the system will be put on the web for public access and evaluation."

        "abstract": "Social interactions preceding and succeeding trust formation can be significant indicators of the phenomena in online social networks. In this research we analyse the social interaction trends that lead and follow formation of trust in these networks. This enables us to hypothesize novel theories responsible for explaining formation of trust in online social settings. The key insights we gather from this research are the facts that a certain level of socialization threshold needs to be met in order for trust to develop between two individuals. This threshold differs across persons and across networks. Once the trust relation has developed between a pair of characters connected by some social relation (also referred to as character dyad), trust can be maintained with a lower rate of socialization.\n\nOur first set of experiments comprise of the relationship prediction problem. We predict the emergence of a social relationship like grouping, mentoring and trading between two individuals over a period of time by looking at the past characteristics of the network. We find that features related to trust have very little impact on this prediction. In the final set of experiments, we predict the formation of trust between individuals by looking at the topographical and semantic social interaction features between them. We generated three semantic dimensions for this task which can be recomputed with an observed social variable (say grouping) to create a new semantic social variable. In this endeavor, we successfully show that, including features related to socialization, gives us an approximate increase of 4-9% accuracy for trust relationship predictions."

        "abstract": "In practical military or first responder deployment scenarios, information flows need to adhere to specified policies regardless of the physical connectivity of nodes. Nodes in such networks are associated with various levels in a command-and-control hierarchy; and therefore typically form a logical hierarchical tree network that is used to route both command and data traffic. Associated with this logical hierarchical network is a communication network that represents the connectivity of these nodes in the deployed scenario. Such composite networks introduce constraints that can result in information flows having to traverse much longer paths in the underlying communication network. In this paper, we look at the problem of adding edges to a logical hierarchical network (or any other social network) so as to minimize the number of hops required to route data traffic in the underlying communication network from a node to other specified nodes. The edges added are a subset of all possible edges in the complementary logical hierarchical graph and have to satisfy specified hierarchical constraints. First, we consider the general problem of minimizing the eccentricity of a source node 's' (where eccentricity of 's' is the maximum of the shortest paths from 's' to all other nodes) in a metric graph on adding upto 'B' unequal cost metric edges from the set of all edges in the complementary graph. We develop an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm for this case that outperforms existing constant factor algorithms for eccentricity minimization. Here the added edge metric cost as well as the graph edge metric cost correspond to the number of hops in the shortest path required to route traffic in the actual deployed topology (i.e., underlying communication network). Next, we consider the case where the set of possible added edges is a specified subset of the edges in the complementary graph and the set of destinations is a subset of the graph nodes. For this case, we develop heuristic algorithms based on the previous eccentricity minimizing algorithm that show good performance. We validate our algorithms using two realistic military deployment scenarios. We find that adding even a low number of hierarchically constrained edges (of the order of 10) can cause a significant decrease (around 50%) in the eccentricity of a node in the logical hierarchical network and thus can reduce the number of hops required for data traffic traversal."

        "abstract": "In the real world, various systems can be modeled using heterogeneous networks which consist of entities of different types. People like to discover groups (or cliques) of entities linked to each other with rare and surprising associations from such networks. We define such anomalous cliques as Association-Based Clique Outliers (ABCOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks, and design effective approaches to detect them. The need to find such outlier cliques from networks can be formulated as a conjunctive select query consisting of a set of (type, predicate) pairs. Answering such conjunctive queries efficiently involves two main challenges: (1) computing all matching cliques which satisfy the query and (2) ranking such results based on the rarity and the interestingness of the\nassociations among entities in the cliques. In this paper, we address these two challenges as follows. First, we introduce a new low-cost graph index to assist clique matching. Second, we define the outlierness of an association between two entities based on their attribute values and provide a methodology to efficiently compute such outliers given a conjunctive select query. Experimental results on several synthetic datasets and the Wikipedia dataset containing thousands of entities show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in computing interesting ABCOutliers."

        "abstract": "We introduce a framework for topical keyphrase generation and ranking, based on the output of a topic model run on a collection of short documents. By shifting from the unigram-centric traditional methods of keyphrase extraction and ranking to a phrase-centric approach, we are able to directly compare and rank phrases of different lengths. Our method defines a function to rank topical keyphrases so that more highly ranked keyphrases are considered to be better index phrases for that topic. We also apply our approach to work with heterogeneous data, and construct an entity-specific topical keyphrase ranking function.  This allows us to represent a topic with respect to an entity - for instance, a research area as seen from the viewpoint of a particular author. We study the performance of our framework on multiple real world document collections."

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous networks are ubiquitous. For example, bibliographic data, social data, medical records, movie data and many more can be modeled as heterogeneous networks. Rich information associated with multi-typed nodes in heterogeneous networks motivates us to propose a new definition of outliers, which is different from those defined for homogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Community Distribution Outliers (CDOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks, which are defined as objects whose community distribution does not follow any of the popular community distribution patterns.We extract such outliers using a type-aware joint analysis of multiple types of objects. Given community membership matrices for all types of objects, we follow an iterative two-stage approach which performs pattern discovery and outlier detection in a tightly integrated manner. We first propose a\nnovel outlier-aware approach based on joint non-negative matrix factorization to discover popular community distribution patterns for all the object types in a holistic manner, and then detect outliers based on such patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach is highly effective in discovering interesting community distribution outliers.\n"

In the past, scientists have looked at the web as a large connected component to understand how the topology of hyperlinks correlates with the quality of information contained in the page and they proposed techniques to rank information contained in web pages. We argue that information from web pages and network data on social relationships can be combined to create a personalized and socially connected web. In this paper, we look at the web as a composition of two networks, one consisting of information in web pages and the other of personal data shared on social media web sites. Together, they allow us to analyze how social media tunnels the flow of information from person to person and how to use the structure of the social network to rank, deliver, and organize information specifically for each individual user. We validate our social ranking concepts through a ranking experiment conducted on web pages that users shared on Google Buzz and Twitter. ."

The system carries out a\nsequence of tasks, where each task relates to a random event\nthat must be observed. The accumulated information obtained\nfrom the sensor devices is reported once per task to a higher\nlayer application at the end user. The utility of each report\ndepends on the timeliness of the report and also on the quality\nof the observations. Quality can be improved by accumulating\nmore observations for the same task, at the expense of delay. We\nassume new tasks arrive randomly, and the qualities of each new\nobservation are also random. The goal is to maximize time average\nquality of information subject to cost constraints. We solve\nthe problem by leveraging dynamic programming and Lyapunov\noptimization. Our algorithms involve solving a 2-dimensional optimal\nstopping problem, and result in a 2-dimensional threshold\nrule. When task arrivals are i.i.d., the optimal solution to the\nstopping problem can be closely approximated with a small\nnumber of simplified value iterations. When task arrivals are\nperiodic, we derive a structured form approximately optimal\nstopping policy. We also introduce hybrid policies applied over\nthe proposed adaptive sampling algorithms to further improve\nthe performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our policies\nperform near optimal.

        "abstract": "Communication gains from relaying can be acquired even in the absence of altruistic or dedicated relays. To accommodate this, spectrum leasing for cooperation paradigm prescribes that the potential relaying node is rewarded for its relaying role with a fraction of source's bandwidth. Recently, a two-hop spectrum leasing scheme was proposed that enables the source to employ the relay only to an extent it finds beneficial, preserving the remaining bandwidth for its direct transmission, if necessary. Such a solution adds flexibility that can be particularly useful for implementation in networks involving more than two hops. In this paper, we extend this setup to include the relay selection problem in a two-hop network scenario with multiple potential relays. Since the potential relays are selfish nodes, their competitive attitude for accessing the spectrum needs to be taken into account. In addition to Stackelberg game framework used in the original setting with one relay, auction theory is applied to model the relay selection process. Analysis and numerical results are provided, demonstrating that the source-destination pair can achieve significant benefits emanating from the competitive nature of the relays."

TE is collected and maintained in a distributed manner by the nodes in the network and can be queried on demand by a network forensics system to trace past events. The latter can facilitate crucial applications such as identifying malicious or malfunctioning nodes. Recently, we developed an analytical framework towards computing the likelihood of TE availability in wireless networks. Our prior efforts  brought to light the impact of the network's operational parameters (such as transmission rate and packet length) on the availability of TE.\nHowever, provisioning for TE could impact the network performance in terms of throughput and/or delay.\nOur objective in this work is to  capture and quantify the trade-offs between provisioning transmission evidence and achieving high performance in wireless networks.  In particular, we investigate the network performance hit, under the constraint of TE availability guarantees. Our results indicate that the performance remains unaffected up to a certain TE requirement. Beyond this, the throughput could degrade and the delay could increase by as much as 30 %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind."

        "abstract": "Community has received considerable attention because of its application to many practical problems in mobile networks. However, when considering temporal information associated with community (i.e., transient community), most existing community detection methods fail due to their aggregation of the network to a single weighted or unweighted binary network. In this paper, we propose a contact-burst-based clustering method to detect transient communities by exploiting the pairwise contact processes. In this method, we formulate each pairwise contact process as regular appearance of contact bursts, during which most contacts between the pair of nodes happen. Based on such formulation, we detect transient communities by clustering the pairs of nodes with similar contact bursts together. We also propose a new data forwarding strategy for delay tolerant networks, in which transient communities serve as the data forwarding unit. Evaluation results show that our strategy can achieve much higher data delivery ratio than traditional community-based strategies with comparable network overhead."

Although relay selection is an important issue, other issues such as finding the right content or quickly answering user queries are also very important since the ultimate goal of using mobile opportunistic network is to provide the right content to mobile users (nodes). In this paper, we study the query answering problem in content-based mobile opportunistic networks, where the objective is to minimize the average query delay given a sequence of queries considering the node expertise, node queuing delay and communication delay. To solve this problem, we propose various query forwarding approaches under deterministic and probabilistic expertise models. Specifically, we propose centralized approaches to assign queries based on a modified Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and distributed approaches in which query forwarding is based on a utility metric. Extensive simulations on both synthetic and realistic traces demonstrate that our solutions outperform existing approaches."

        "abstract": "Collective behavior has been related repeatedly to information.  Recently, work has noted that emotional states can change how information is processed, suggesting that good information states can be undermined or strengthened by emotional states 1-4.  Yet, how emotions relate to collective decision-making and are transmitted throughout a collective is largely unknown 5, 6.  Here, we analyzed approximately 1,000,000 complex, speed-based decisions made under natural experimental conditions by 39 decisions-makers.  We report two main results.  Decision errors are lowest at intermediate levels of emotional activation and increase as much as 22% as a decision-maker becomes increasingly inactivated or highly activated.  Emotional activation states are transmitted from person-to-person via e-communications.  These results provide unique natural experimental data on cognition and emotions, reveal emotional transmission in electronic communication networks, and suggest that the one-to-many scaling properties of mobile communications can have broad effects on collective behavior.

Here we show that a single retraction triggers citation losses through an authors prior body of work.

These chain reactions are sustained on authors papers (a) published up to a decade earlier and (b) connected within the authors own citation network by up to 4 degrees of separation from the retracted publication. Importantly, however, citation losses among prior work disappear when authors self-report the error.  Our analyses and results span the range of scientific disciplines."

When someone becomes a member of a group, he or she is endowed with cultural capital from that group, and when someone becomes a member of multiple groups, he or she becomes multivocal.  We hypothesize that triads of diverse individuals are more likely to emerge when a multivocal individual is present, and without these diverse triads, the network structure breaks apart.  Thus, the removal of multivocal individuals from the network disintegrates the network topography, an effect that grows stronger once the groups that provided the cultural capital and multivocality stabilize and become institutionalized.  To provide empirical support for these hypotheses, we use a variety of methodologies to analyze the artist networks of the Broadway musical industry."

Applications of game-theoretic analysis to network security have generally been limited to highly stylized models, where simplified environments enable tractable study of key strategic variables. We propose a simulation-based approach to game-theoretic analysis of protocol compliance, for scenarios with large populations of agents and large policy spaces. We define a general procedure for systematically exploring a structured policy space, directed expressly to resolve the qualitative classification of equilibrium behavior as compliant or non-compliant. The techniques are illustrated and exercised through an extensive case study analyzing compliance incentives for introduction-based routing. We find that the benefits of complying with the protocol are particularly strong for nodes subject to attack, and the overall compliance level achieved in equilibrium, while not universal, is sufficient to support the desired security goals of the protocol."

In this paper, we present our results on the relationship between personality and users' movie preferences, and their opinions about, use of, and trust in recommender systems. Using surveys and analysis of system data for 73 Netflix users, we show correlations between personality and preferences for specific movie genres that replicate and extend previous results. Our most significant result is that the personality trait of Conscientious is consistently positively correlated with a higher opinion about the usefulness and trustworthiness of recommendations, self-reports of how frequently they were used, and ratings of recommended items. We discuss the implications these results have for evaluating and improving recommender systems.\n"

Hence novel models incorporating dynamic user behavior are needed. To this end, we propose a model for individual social media users, termed a genotype. The genotype is a per-topic summary of a users interest, activity and susceptibility to adopt new information. We demonstrate that user genotypes remain invariant within a topic by adopting them for classification of new information spread in large-scale real networks. Furthermore, we extract topic-specific influence backbone structures based on information adoption and show that they differ significantly from the static follower network. When employed for influence prediction of new content spread, our genotype model and influence backbones enable more than 20% improvement, compared to purely structural features. We also demonstrate that knowledge of user genotypes and influence backbones allow for the design of effective strategies for latency minimization of topic-specific information spread."

This leads to the tragedy of the commons in which rational action will ultimately make everyone worse-off. Traditional policies to promote cooperation involve Pigouvian taxation or subsidies that make individuals internalize the externality they incur. We introduce a new approach to achieving global cooperation by localizing externalities to one's peers in a social network, thus leveraging the power of peer-pressure to regulate behavior. The mechanism relies on a joint model of externalities and peer-pressure. Surprisingly, this mechanism can require a lower budget to operate than the Pigouvian mechanism, even when accounting for the social cost of peer pressure. Even when the available budget is very low, the social mechanisms achieve greater improvement in the outcome."

In this paper the problem of extending the label of gold farmers to players which are not labeled as such is considered. Two main classes of techniques are described and evaluated: Network-based approaches and similarity based approaches. It is also explored how dividing\nthe problem further by relabeling the data based on behavioral patterns can further improve the results."

Team science networks have certain unique characteristics in their conception and intent that set them apart from other commonly studied social and collaboration networks. We study the structural properties, and present metrics for collaborative performance assessment in two real-world team science networks initiated by the Army Research Lab. We model a team using a higher-order generalization of an edge called a \\\\emph{simplex}. A simplex captures group relationships distinct from the union of pair-wise relationships.  Our evaluation using a rigorous methodology reveals that the distributions of vertex and facet degrees (the number of maximal groups that a vertex belongs to) follow a power law, but with exponential cut-off at the tail in most cases.  We propose metrics for quantitatively assessing the extent of intra-team and extra-team collaborations, and compare their effectiveness vis-a-vis our intuitive notions. Our work can be used as the basis for generative models, and for evaluating the collaborative performance of team science networks."

        "abstract": "Some recent studies have shown that cooperative cache can improve the system performance in wireless P2P networks\nsuch as ad hoc networks and mesh networks. However, all these studies are at a very high level, leaving many design and\nimplementation issues unanswered. In this paper, we present our design and implementation of cooperative cache in wireless P2P\nnetworks, and propose solutions to find the best place to cache the data. We propose a novel asymmetric cooperative cache approach,\nwhere the data requests are transmitted to the cache layer on every node, but the data replies are only transmitted to the cache layer at\nthe intermediate nodes that need to cache the data. This solution not only reduces the overhead of copying data between the user\nspace and the kernel space, it also allows data pipelines to reduce the end-to-end delay. We also study the effects of different MAC\nlayers, such as 802.11-based ad hoc networks and multi-interface-multichannel-based mesh networks, on the performance of\ncooperative cache. Our results show that the asymmetric approach outperforms the symmetric approach in traditional 802.11-based\nad hoc networks by removing most of the processing overhead. In mesh networks, the asymmetric approach can significantly reduce\nthe data access delay compared to the symmetric approach due to data pipelines."

        "abstract": "Trust is a fundamental concept in many real-world applications such as e-commerce and peer-to-peer networks. In these applications, users can generate local opinions about the counterparts based on direct experiences, and these opinions can then be aggregated to build trust among unknown users. The mechanism to build new trust relationships based on existing ones is referred to as trust inference. State-of-the-art trust inference approaches employ the transitivity property of trust by propagating trust along connected users. In this paper, we propose a novel trust inference model (MaTrust) by exploring an equally important property of trust, i.e., the multi-aspect property. MaTrust directly characterizes multiple latent factors for each trustor and trustee from the locally-generated trust relationships. Furthermore, it can naturally incorporate prior knowledge as specified factors. These factors in turn serve as the basis to infer the unseen trustworthiness scores. Experimental evaluations on real data sets show that the proposed MaTrust significantly outperforms several benchmark trust inference models in both effectiveness and efficiency."

We present two optimization formations and their corresponding optimization solutions. Our method can naturally capture abnormal behaviors on graphs.

One way to address this kind of data is training a nonlinear\nclassifier such as kernel support vector machine (kernel SVM). However, the computational burden of kernel SVM limits its\napplication to large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a Clustered Support Vector Machine (CSVM), which tackles the data\nin a divide and conquer manner. More specifically, CSVM groups the data into several clusters, followed which it trains a linear support vector machine in each cluster to separate the data locally. Meanwhile, CSVM has an additional global regularization, which requires the weight vector of each local linear SVM aligning with a global weight vector. The global regularization leverages the information from one cluster to another, and avoids over-fitting in each cluster. We derive a data-dependent generalization error bound\nfor CSVM, which explains the advantage of CSVM over linear SVM. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms linear SVM and some other related locally linear classifiers. It is also comparable to a fine-tuned kernel\nSVM in terms of prediction performance, while it is more efficient than kernel SVM."

Some studies suggest that by leveraging additional user and / or item relations, e.g., social network, the performance of the recommendation models can be improved. These studies, nevertheless, mostly utilize a single type of external relationship. Considering the heterogeneity of real-world applications, we propose to position the well-studied recommendation problem in a heterogeneous information network context and attempt to incorporate different recommendation factors. We discuss how heterogeneous information network can benefit recommender systems and then propose a matrix factorization based unified recommendation model to take advantage of both rating data and the related information network.

Link prediction in sparse networks presents a significant challenge due to the inherent disproportion of links that can form to links that do form. Previous research has typically approached this as an unsupervised problem. While this is not the first work to explore supervised learning, many factors significant in influencing and guiding classification remain unexplored. In this paper, we consider these factors by first motivating the use of a supervised framework through a careful investigation of issues such as network observational period, generality of existing methods, variance reduction, topological causes and degrees of imbalance, and sampling approaches. We also present an effective flow-based predicting algorithm, offer formal bounds on imbalance in sparse network link prediction, and employ an evaluation method appropriate for the observed imbalance. Our careful consideration of the above issues ultimately leads to a completely general framework that outperforms unsupervised link prediction methods by more than 30% AUC."

        "abstract": "We consider the network-wide broadcast problem in multihop wireless networks with reliable multicast at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, that is, where the MAC layer attempts to guarantee delivery using acknowledgements and retransmissions. This implies that the cost of transmitting to downstream nodes at each branch point in the broadcast tree depends on the number of recipients. We model the cost of transmitting to $k$ downstream nodes as $1+A k^b$, where $k$ is the number of intended recipients, $b \\\\ge 0$, and $A \\\\ge 0$. This allows us to capture a wide array of MAC-layer approaches and their costs, simply by varying the value of $b$.\n\nWe give a systematic analysis of this problem as parameterized by $b$ (relative to $A$), including positive and negative results. In particular, we show the problem is:\n\\\\begin{itemize}\n\\\\item approximable by a factor varying from $2+2H_{\\\\Delta}$ down to 2 as $b$ varies from 0 to 1 (where $\\\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the network graph and $H_\\\\Delta$ is the $\\\\Delta$th harmonic number), and thence  %(via a modified CDS algorithm)\n\\\\item  approximable by a factor varying from 2 to 1 (i.e., optimal) as $b$ varies from 1 to $\\\\log_2 (\\\\frac{1}{A}+2)$, and\n\\\\item  optimally solvable thereafter. % (both via spanning tree).\n\\\\end{itemize}\n For arbitrary cost functions of the form $1+Af(k)$, these algorithms provide a $2+2H_{\\\\Delta}$-approximation whenever $f(k)$ is sublinear and a $(1+A)/A$-approximation whenever $f(k)$ is superlinear. We also show the problem is optimally solvable for any $b$ when the network is a clique or a tree.\n\nFinally, we perform a simulation study comparing the two algorithms above with other natural heuristics, testing on a range of networks, with varying densities, cost parameters, and reliability models. We find that there is an advantage in algorithms taking into consideration the value $b$, even if $b$ can only be roughly estimated, as is likely in real-life scenarios.\n"

        "abstract": "Dynamic graphs have been applied to model frequently updated data-center networks. Subgraph matching on these networks facilitates key applications such as cloud service placement. Different from the traditional setting, subgraph matching on dynamic graphs has two new properties: (1) node/edge labels on a dynamic graph are frequently updated; and (2) node/edge labels are numerical instead of categorical. Existing graph indexing techniques are not able to adapt to the new setting: they do not scale with very frequent updates; and most of them only support graphs of categorical labels. In this paper, we propose a graph index framework Gradin to address these new challenges. Gradin encodes subgraphs into multidimensional vectors and organizes them with indices such that it can efficiently search the matches for a querys subgraphs and then combine them into the matches for the query. In particular, we propose a multi-dimensional index that handles frequent updates, and analyze how the index parameters affect update\nand search performance with theoretical results. Moreover, we develop pruning algorithms that reduce unnecessary search when combining the matches of a querys subgraphs. Using both real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that Gradin outperforms\nthe baseline approaches up to 10 times."

        "abstract": "Many real-world complex systems can be modeled as dynamic networks with real-valued vertex/edge attributes. Examples include users opinions in social networks and average speeds in a road system. When managing these large dynamic networks, compressing attribute values becomes a key requirement, since it enables the answering of attribute-based queries regarding a node/edge or network region based on a compact representation of the data. To address this problem, we introduce a lossy network compression scheme called Slice Tree (ST), which partitions a network into smooth regions with respect to node/edge values and compresses each value as the average of its region. ST applies a compact representation for network partitions, called slices, that are defined as a center node and radius distance. We propose an importance sampling algorithm to efficiently prune the search space of candidate slices in the ST construction by biasing the sampling process towards the node values that most affect the compression error. The effectiveness of\nST in terms of compression error, compression rate, and running time is demonstrated using synthetic and real datasets. ST scales to million-node instances and removes up to 87% of the error in attribute values with a 10^3 compression ratio. We also illustrate how ST captures relevant phenomena in real networks, such as research collaboration patterns and traffic congestions."

While a bulk of research has focused on mining the evolutionary pattern of homogeneous\nnetworks (e.g., networks of friends), however, most real-world networks are heterogeneous, containing objects of different types,\nsuch as authors, papers, venues, and terms in a bibliographic network. Modeling co-evolution of multi-typed objects can capture\nricher information than that on single-typed objects alone. For example, studying co-evolution of authors, venues, and terms in\na bibliographic network can tell better the evolution of research areas than just examining co-author network or term network\nalone. In this paper, we study mining co-evolution of multi-typed objects in a special type of heterogeneous networks, called\nstar networks, and examine how the multi-typed objects influence each other in the network evolution. A Hierarchical Dirichlet\nProcess Mixture Model-based evolution model is proposed, which detects the co-evolution of multi-typed objects in the form of\nmulti-typed cluster evolution in dynamic star networks. An efficient inference algorithm is provided to learn the proposed model.\nExperiments on several real networks (DBLP, Twitter, and Delicious) validate the effectiveness of the model and the scalability of\nthe algorithm."

        "abstract": "Modularity is widely used to effectively measure the strength of the community structure found by community detection algorithms. However, modularity maximization suffers from two opposite yet coexisting problems: in some cases, it tends to favor small communities over large ones while in others, large communities over small ones. The latter tendency is known in the literature as the resolution limit problem. To address them, we propose to modify modularity by subtracting from it the fraction of edges connecting nodes of different communities and by including community density into modularity. We refer to the modified metric as Modularity Density and we demonstrate that it indeed resolves both problems mentioned above. We describe the motivation for introducing this metric by using intuitively clear and simple examples. We also discuss the results of applying this metric, modularity, and several other popular community quality metrics to two real dynamic networks. The results imply that Modularity Density is consistent with all the community quality measurements but not modularity, which suggests that Modularity Density is an improved measurement of the community quality compared to modularity."

In such a system, multiple service providers (carriers) may compete to carry data from a customer (transmitter). In order to maximize its throughput by carefully allocating power and rate across the carriers, a transmitter needs truthful channel state information from the carriers, which is a challenge as the carriers are self interested entities. We model this as a competitive rate allocation game, in which carriers send bids about their channel quality to the transmitter, and the transmitter allocates power and rate accordingly. To ensure truthful bidding by the carriers, we design an incentive mechanism where the transmitter offers a payment based on a piecewise linear convex function. We prove that for a binary bid, the total rate for the transmitter is at least half of the maximum achievable rate, and it tends to the optimal rate as the number of bits per bid is increased. We also consider the case when the carriers have incomplete information on channel quality; we apply a well-known multi-armed bandit algorithm UCB1 to our problem, and show that the payment the carriers obtain and the total data rate for the transmitter approaches the performance of the known channel case with logarithmic regret."

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the problem of predicting semantic relations expressed by prepositions and develops statistical learning models for predicting the relations, their arguments and the semantic types of the arguments. We define an inventory of 32 relations, building on the word sense disambiguation task for prepositions and collapsing related senses across prepositions. Given a preposition in a sentence, our computational task to jointly model the preposition relation and its arguments along with their semantic types, as a way to support the relation prediction. The annotated data, however, only provides labels for the relation label, and not the arguments and types. We address this by presenting two models for preposition relation labeling. Our generalization of latent structure SVM gives close to 90% accuracy on relation labeling. Further, by jointly predicting the relation, arguments, and their types along with preposition sense, we show that we can not only improve the relation accuracy, but also significantly improve sense prediction accuracy.

In this paper, we study an interesting new problem of automatically discovering opposing opinion networks of users from forum discussions, which are subset of users who are strongly against each other on some topic. Toward this goal, we propose to use signals from both textual content (e.g., who says what) and social interactions (e.g., who talks to whom) which are both abundant in online forums. We also design an optimization formulation to combine all the signals in an unsupervised way. We created a data set by manually annotating forum data on five controversial topics and our experimental results show that the proposed optimization method outperforms several baselines and existing approaches, demonstrating the power of combining both text analysis and social network analysis in analyzing and generating the opposing opinion networks."

In the Bohman-Frieze-Wormald model (BFW) of percolation, edges sampled from a random graph are considered individually and either added to the graph or rejected provided that the fraction of accepted edges is never smaller than a decreasing function with asymptotic value of , a constant. The BFW process has been studied as a model system for investigating the underlying mechanisms leading to discontinuous phase transitions in percolation. Here we focus on the regime   [0.6,0.95] where it is known that only one giant component, denoted C1, initially appears at the discontinuous phase transition. We show that at some point in the supercritical regime C1 stops growing and eventually a second giant component, denoted C2, emerges in a continuous percolation transition. The delay between the emergence of C1 and C2 and their asymptotic sizes both depend on the value of  and we establish by several techniques that there exists a bifurcation point c = 0.763  0.002. For   [0.6,c ), C1 stops growing the instant it emerges and the delay between the emergence of C1 and C2 decreases with increasing . For   (c,0.95], in contrast, C1 continues growing into the supercritical regime and the delay between the emergence of C1 and C2 increases with increasing . As we show, c marks the minimal delay possible between the emergence of C1 and C2 (i.e., the smallest edge density for which C2 can exist). We also establish many features of the continuous percolation of C2 including scaling exponents and relations."

        "abstract": "Work practices vary among software developers. Some are highly focused on a few artifacts; others make wide- ranging contributions. Similarly, some artifacts are mostly au- thored, or owned, by one or few developers; others have very wide ownership. Focus and ownership are related but different phenomena, both with strong effect on software quality. Prior studies have mostly targeted ownership; the measures of own- ership used have generally been based on either simple counts, information-theoretic views of ownership, or social-network views of contribution patterns. We argue for a more general concep- tual view that unifies developer focus and artifact ownership.\nWe analogize the developer-artifact contribution network to a predator-prey food web, and draw upon ideas from ecology to produce a novel, and conceptually unified view of measuring focus and ownership. These measures relate to both cross-entropy and Kullback-Liebler divergence, and simultaneously provide two normalized measures of focus from both the developer and artifact perspectives. We argue that these measures are theoret- ically well-founded, and yield novel predictive, conceptual, and actionable value in software projects. We find that more focused developers introduce fewer defects than defocused developers. In contrast, files that receive narrowly focused activity are more likely to contain defects than other files."

        "abstract": "Idealized models of interconnected networks can provide a labora- tory for studying the consequences of interdependence in real-world networks, in particular those networks constituting societys critical infrastructure. Here we show how random graph models of connectivity between networks can provide insights into shifts in percolation properties and into systemic risk. Tradeoffs abound in many of our results. For instance, edges between net- works confer global connectivity using relatively few edges, and that con- nectivity can be beneficial in situations like communication or supplying resources, but it can prove dangerous if epidemics were to spread on the network. For a specific model of cascades of load in the system (namely, the sandpile model), we find that each network minimizes its risk of undergo- ing a large cascade if it has an intermediate amount of connectivity to other networks. Thus, connections among networks confer benefits and costs that balance at optimal amounts. However, what is optimal for minimizing cas- cade risk in one network is suboptimal for minimizing risk in the collection of networks. This work provides tools for modeling interconnected networks (or single networks with mesoscopic structure), and it provides hypotheses on tradeoffs in interdependence and their implications for systemic risk."

        "abstract": "The past few years have seen explosive growth of online social networks along with the proliferation of communication networks such as the Internet, wireline telephone networks, cellular telephone networks, and even multi-hop wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, in specialized application scenarios such as disaster relief and battlefield operations. Human beings usually share information with folks they know, who subsequently forward that information along various links in the social network, either verbatim (e.g., directives from a leader flowing through the chain of command) or after modifications (e.g., propagation of rumors, gossip, or news from the field to the newspaper reader). This results in a social network constraining or guiding the spread of information according to its topology. Such constraints can result in a piece of information having to traverse much longer paths in the underlying communication network between the producer and the ultimate consumer of the information than it would have to in the absence of constraints. This stretch is justified because either the intermediaries could play a critical role in interpreting/massaging the information or they serve as important links in the acquaintance chain, without whom the producer and the ultimate consumer would not know each other.\n\nThe total time taken for a piece of information to spread through the entire social network in the aforementioned constrained fashion is often different from the time taken to simply multicast the information on the underlying communication network. Additionally, a piece of information may traverse a communication link or a node\nseveral times during the process. While this is not an issue for lightweight content such as text, it can be a major issue for multimedia content, especially in an ad hoc network/DTN setting where accessing multimedia content directly from a server over a flaky network is not reliable.\n\nIn this chapter, we present a systematic analytical study of the constrained information flow problem  in particular, we model a pair of networks (social and communication) as a composite graph  structures that result from embedding the former network into the latter using mapping functions (or embedding functions) that can map a social network node to a communications network node when the former uses the latter as his/her communication portal. We study the unicast, broadcast, and multicast versions of the problem.\n\nWe analytically study how the constrained composite path stretch and constrained composite broadcast time metrics scale with the sizes of both networks under consideration. One application scenario where this can be useful is a random deployment of workers or soldiers in a disaster relief site and their leader attempting to disseminate instructions and directives along his/her chain of command (essentially a social network of sorts). These messages trace a logical path in the social network which translates to a longer physical path on the underlying communication network.\n\nInformation multicast through a chain of command hierarchy can also be modeled in the composite graph framework. For many operations and missions in practice, mere topological proximity to certain recipients of a message does not warrant its direct delivery to the latter. Instead, certain hierarchical policies that define different roles and ranks of network nodes may constrain the message flow through the network. For example, in military networks, communications between various nodes may need to be observed and then cleared by individuals located higher in the chain-of-command hierarchy, which is nothing but a social network. It is often the case that a subset of nodes in the hierarchy are interested in participating together in a multicast session. Therefore, we are motivated to construct multicast routes that connect these nodes while being constrained by the relationships in the hierarchy."

We present a simple, fast, combinatorial algorithm that takes a set of demands and constructs a single tree T such that for all f the cost f(T) is a 47.45-approximation of the optimal cost for that particular f. This is within a factor of 2.33 of the best approximation ratio currently achievable when the tree can be optimized for a specific function. Trees achieving simultaneous O(1)-approximations for all concave functions were previously not known to exist regardless of computation time."

        "abstract": "The current research used the context of US Presidential debates to examine whether matching the linguistic style of an opponent in a two-party exchange affects the reactions of third-party observers. Research on status inferences would predict that linguistic style matching (LSM) during a Presidential debate would negatively impact subsequent poll numbers because LSM implies followership.  In contrast, building off the processing fluency literature, we propose that LSM during a Presidential debate will improve subsequent poll numbers because debate answers that match their opponent's linguistic style will be easier to process.  Because recency increases fluency, we further predicted that LSM would have a greater effect later in the debate. This would be a fluency-on-fluency effect (fluency from LSM and recency).  Fixed-effects regression and coincidence analyses demonstrated that candidates who matched their opponents linguistic style, particularly in the later 40% of the debate, increased their standing in the polls.  A lab study experimentally manipulating LSM strongly confirms the empirical regularity found in the observational data and indicates a causal relationships exists between LSM and 3rd party reactions."

Here we develop a model that captures the essential self-organizing mechanisms of Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpiles on networks, a self-organized critical (SOC) system. This model enables studying a simple control scheme that determines the frequency of cascades and that shapes systemic risk. We show that optimal strategies exist for generic cost functions and that controlling a subcritical system may drive it to criticality. This approach could enable controlling other self-organizing systems."

        "abstract": "Modeling trust in very large social networks is a hard problem due to\nthe highly noisy nature of these networks that span trust\nrelationships from many different contexts, based on judgments of\nreliability, dependability and competence. Furthermore, relationships\nin these networks vary in their level of strength. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel extension of structural balance theory as a\nfoundational theory of trust and distrust in networks. Our theory\npreserves the distinctions between trust and distrust as suggested in\nthe literature, but also incorporates the notion of relationship\nstrength which can be expressed as either discrete categorical values,\nas pairwise comparisons or as metric distances. Our model is novel,\nhas sound social and psychological basis, and captures the classical\nbalance theory as a special case. We then propose a convergence model,\ndescribing how an imbalanced network evolves towards new balance and\nformulate the convergence problem of a social network as a Metric\nMultidimensional Scaling (MDS) optimization problem.  Finally, we show\nhow the convergence model can be used to predict edge signs in social\nnetworks, and justify our theory through extensive experiments on real\ndatasets.\n"

We study how users online dating behaviors correlate with various user attributes using a real-world dateset from a major online dating site in China. Our study provides a firsthand account of the user online dating behaviors in China, a country with a large population and unique culture. Our results reveal how users message sending and replying behaviors correlate with various user attributes, and how users actual online dating behaviors deviate from their stated preferences.

        "abstract": "Exploring statistics of locally connected subgraph patterns (also known as network motifs) has helped researchers to better understand the structure and function of biological and online social networks (OSNs). Nowadays the massive size of some critical networks -- often stored in already overloaded relational databases -- effectively limits the rate in which nodes and edges are explored, making it challenging to accurately discover subgraph statistics. In this work, we propose to use sampling methods to accurately estimate subgraph statistics from as few queried nodes as possible. We present sampling algorithms that efficiently and accurately estimate subgraph properties of massive networks. Our algorithms require no pre-computation or complete network topology information. At the same time, we provide theoretical guarantees of convergence. We perform experiments using widely known data sets, and show that for the same accuracy, our algorithms require an order of magnitude less queries (samples) than the current state-of-the-art algorithms."

To date, most of the related literature on maximizing this network cover assumes that the social network topology is known. Even in such a case the coverage problem is NP- hard. In practice, the network topology is generally unknown and needs to be discovered on-the-fly. In this paper we assume that the topology is gradually discovered thanks to recruited individuals disclosing their social connections. Our goal is to provide an efficient online algorithm that recruits individuals so as to maximize the size of target audience covered by the campaign.\nWe analyze the performance of a variety of online my- opic algorithms (i.e. that do not have a priori information on the topology) currently used to sample and search large net- works, including the Flickr and YouTube networks. We also propose a new greedy online algorithm, Maximum Expected Uncovered Degree (MEUD). Our proposed algorithm greedily maximizes the expected size of the cover, but it requires the degree distribution to be known. For a class of random power law networks we show that MEUD simplifies into a straightforward procedure, denoted as MOD because it re- quires only the knowledge of the Maximum Observed Degree. We substantiate our analytical results with extensive simulations and show that MOD significantly outperforms all analyzed myopic algorithms."

This study sheds light on these mechanisms. We are particularly interested in OSNs where current subscribers can invite new users to join the network (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn). Measuring the relationship between subscriber activity and net- work growth of a large OSN over five years, we formulate three hypotheses that together describe the observed OSN subscriber behavior. We then provide a model (and extensions) that simultaneously satisfies all three hypotheses. Our model predicts four distinct subscriber activity behaviors and provides deep insights into the dynamics of subscriber activity, inactivity, and network growth rates. Finally, we present activity data of nearly thirty OSN websites, measured over five years, and show that the observed activity is well described by one of the four time series predicted by our model."

        "abstract": "Spatial networks, in which nodes and edges are embedded in space, play a vital role in the study of complex\nsystems. For example, many social networks attach geo-location information to each user, allowing the study of\nnot only topological interactions between users, but spatial interactions as well. The defining property of spatial\nnetworks is that edge distances are associated with a cost, which may subtly influence the topology of the\nnetwork. However, the cost function over distance is rarely known, thus developing a model of connections in\nspatial networks is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for capturing the interaction between\nspatial effects and network structure. Our approach represents a unique combination of ideas from latent variable\nstatistical models and spatial network modeling. In contrast to previous work, we view the ability to form\nlong/short-distance connections to be dependent on the individual nodes involved. For example, a nodes specific\nsurroundings (e.g. network structure and node density) may make it more likely to form a long distance link than\nother nodes with the same degree. To capture this information, we attach a latent variable to each node which\nrepresents a nodes spatial reach. These variables are inferred from the network structure using a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo algorithm. We experimentally evaluate our proposed model on 4 different types of real-world spatial\nnetworks (e.g. transportation, biological, infrastructure, and social). We apply our model to the task of link prediction and achieve up to a 35% improvement over previous approaches in terms of the area under the ROC curve. Additionally, we show that our model is particularly helpful for predicting links between nodes with low degrees. In these cases, we see much larger improvements over previous models."

Graph models inspired by spatial data have been proposed to improve the support for applications, such as link prediction, community detection, and so on. In this paper, we focus on link prediction problems. In particular, we formulate a constrained link prediction problem: given a weighted graph G, a node v of G, a newly incoming node u, and a threshold h, the goal is to estimate the likelihood that node u and node v form an edge such that the weight of the edge is no less than h. We applied existing techniques to solve the link prediction problem: (1) a preferential attachment based method; (2) a preferential attachment and nodes distance based method; and (3) a latent parameter model. Moreover, we conducted an experimental study to (1) investigate how these techniques perform on the D4D dataset by varying the threshold, and (2) analyze the factors that influence their performance."

The framework introduces the concept of *symptotic\nscalability* to determine the number of nodes to which a network\nscales, and a metric called *change impact value* (CIV) for comparing\nthe impact of underlying system parameters on network scalability.  A\nkey idea is to divide analysis into generic and specific parts\nconnected via a *signature* -- a set of governing parameters of a\nnetwork scenario -- such that analyzing a new network scenario reduces\nmainly to identifying its signature.\n\nUsing this framework, we present the first symptotic scalability\nexpressions for line, grid, clique, randomized grid and mobile\ntopologies. We model both TDMA and 802.11, as well as unicast and\nbroadcast traffic.  We compare the analysis with discrete event\nsimulations and show that the model provides sufficiently accurate\nestimates of scalability.  We show how our impact analysis methodology\ncan be used to tune network features to meet a scaling requirement. We\nuncover several new insights, for instance, on the limited impact of\nreducing routing overhead, the differential nature of flooding\ntraffic, and the dramatic reduction in scalability with real-world\nmobility patterns.\n"

        "abstract": "Collective behavior has been related repeatedly to information.  Recently, work has noted that emotional states can change how information is processed, suggesting that good information states can be undermined or strengthened by emotional states 1-4.  Yet, how emotions relate to collective decision-making and are transmitted throughout a collective is largely unknown 5, 6.  Here, we analyzed approximately 1,000,000 complex, speed-based decisions made under natural experimental conditions by 39 decisions-makers.  We report two main results.  Decision errors are lowest at intermediate levels of emotional activation and increase as much as 22% as a decision-maker becomes increasingly inactivated or highly activated.  Emotional activation states are transmitted from person-to-person via e-communications.  These results provide unique natural experimental data on cognition and emotions, reveal emotional transmission in electronic communication networks, and suggest that the one-to-many scaling properties of mobile communications can have broad effects on collective behavior.

Comparing core/periphery structures with network modules, we\ndiscriminate between global and local cores. The core/periphery network organization lies in\nthe middle of several extreme properties, such as random/condensed structures, clique/star\nconfigurations, network symmetry/asymmetry, network assortativity/disassortativity, as well\nas network hierarchy/anti-hierarchy. These properties of high complexity together with the\nlarge degeneracy of core pathways ensuring cooperation and providing multiple options of\nnetwork flow re-channelling greatly contribute to the high robustness of complex systems.\nCore processes enable a coordinated response to various stimuli, decrease noise, and evolve\nslowly. The integrative function of network cores is an important step in the development of\na large variety of complex organisms and organizations. In addition to these important\nfeatures and several decades of research interest, studies on core/periphery networks still\nhave a number of unexplored areas."

Such shared membership of different communities leads to overlapping communities. Detecting such overlapping communities is a challenging and computationally intensive problem. In this paper, we investigate the usability of high performance computing in the area of social networks and community detection. We present highly scalable variants of a community detection algorithm called Speaker-listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA). We show that despite of irregular data dependencies in the computation, parallel computing paradigms can significantly speed up the detection of overlapping communities of social networks which is computationally expensive. We show by experiments, how various parallel computing architectures can be utilized to analyze large social network data on both shared memory machines and distributed memory machines, such as IBM Blue Gene."

        "abstract": "Modularity is widely used to effectively measure the strength of the community structure found by community detection algorithms. However, modularity maximization suffers from two opposite yet coexisting problems: in some cases, it tends to favor small communities over large ones while in others, large communities over small ones. The latter tendency is known in the literature as the resolution limit problem. To address them, we propose to modify modularity by subtracting from it the fraction of edges connecting nodes of different communities and by including community density into modularity. We refer to the modified metric as Modularity Density and we demonstrate that it indeed resolves both problems mentioned above. We describe the motivation for introducing this metric by using intuitively clear and simple examples. We also prove that this new metric solves the resolution limit problem. Finally,\nwe discuss the results of applying this metric, modularity, and several other popular community quality metrics to two real dynamic networks. The results imply that Modularity Density is consistent with all the community quality measurements but not modularity, which suggests that Modularity Density is an improved measurement of the community quality compared to modularity."

We find that the communications were more likely to occur among those with similar alcohol use and connections also drove those involved in them to have similar drinking behaviors.

        "abstract": "Increased popularity of microblogs in recent years brings about a need for better mechanisms to extract credible or otherwise useful information from noisy and large data. While there are a great number of studies that introduce methods to find credible data, there is no accepted credibility benchmark. As a result, it is hard to compare different studies and generalize from their findings. In this paper, we argue for a methodology for making such studies more useful to the research community. First, the underlying ground truth values of credibility must be reliable. The specific constructs used to define credibility must be carefully identified. Secondly, the underlying network context must be quantified and documented. To illustrate these two points, we con- duct a unique credibility study of two different data sets on the same topic, but with different network characteristics. We also conduct two different user surveys, and construct two additional indicators of credibility based on retweet behavior. Through a detailed statistical study, we first show that survey based methods can be extremely noisy and results may vary greatly from survey to survey. However, by combining such methods with retweet behavior, we can incorporate two signals that are noisy but uncor- related, resulting in ground truth measures that can be predicted with high accuracy and are stable across different data sets and survey methods. Newswor- thiness of tweets can be a useful frame for specific applications, but it is not necessary for achieving reliable credibility ground truth measurements. We also show that the underlying model for predicting credibility can differ depending on the underlying network context, which needs to be clearly identified and reported in credibility studies to improve their impact."

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper develops and evaluates algorithms for exploiting physical constraints to improve the reliability of social sensing. Social sensing refers to applications where a group of sources (e.g., individuals and their mobile devices) volunteer to collect observations about the physical world. A key challenge in social sensing is that the reliability of sources and their devices is generally unknown, which makes it non-trivial to assess the correctness of collected observations. To solve this problem, the paper adopts a cyber-physical approach, where assessment of correctness of individual observations is aided by knowledge of physical constraints on both sources and observed variables to compensate for the lack of information on source reliability. We cast the problem as one of maximum likelihood estimation. The goal is to jointly estimate both (i) the latent physical state of the observed environment, and (ii) the inferred reliability of individual sources such that they are maximally consistent with both provenance information (who claimed what) and physical constraints. We evaluate the new framework through a real-world social sensing application. The results demonstrate significant performance gains in estimation accuracy of both source reliability and observation correctness."

With the growth of these social networks, individuals resort to them for reporting events in their daily lives. Examples of such events include earthquakes, protests, games, and almost every aspect of our lives. In this paper, we seek to understand and model the spread of large scale events (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes) in the space and time dimensions (integral elements of our daily lives) using inputs from social networks (e.g., tweets, FaceBook status updates). In particular, we illustrate the spread of one such event - gas shortage in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. We show that epidemiological models are inaccurate in modeling such an event and develop new models to accurately capture the spread of this event. We evaluate the accuracy of our model using over 2 million tweets collected over a period of 22 days and show that we perform significantly better than standard epidemiological models."

The key finding of this study is that the process of cascading failures is non-self-averaging on spatial networks, and\nthus, aggregate inferences made from analyzing an ensemble of such networks lead to incorrect conclusions when applied to a single\nnetwork, no matter how large the network is. We demonstrate that this lack of self-averaging disappears with the introduction of a\nsmall fraction of long-range links into the network. We simulate the well studied preemptive node removal strategy for cascade mitigation and show that it is largely ineffective in the case of spatial networks. We introduce an altruistic strategy designed to limit the\nloss of network nodes in the event of a cascade triggering failure and show that it performs better than the preemptive strategy.\nFinally, we consider a real-world spatial network viz. a European power transmission network and validate that our findings from the\nstudy of random geometric graphs are also borne out by simulations of cascading failures on the empirical network."

Here we consider the domain of American cinema and explore these questions using a database of films spanning a 70 year period. We use crowdsourced keywords from the Internet Movie Database as a window into the contents of films, and prescribe novelty scores for each film based on occurrence probabilities of individual keywords and keyword-pairs. These scores provide revealing insights into the dynamics of novelty in cinema. We investigate how novelty influences the revenue generated by a film, and find a relationship that resembles the Wundt-Berlyne curve. We also study the statistics of keyword occurrence and the aggregate distribution of keywords over a 100 year period."

Due to their complex schemas and variational information descriptions, it becomes very hard for users to formulate a query that can be properly processed by the existing systems. We argue that for a user-friendly graph query engine, it must support various kinds of transformations such as synonym, abbreviation, and ontology. Furthermore, the derived query results must be ranked in a principled manner.  In this paper, we introduce a novel framework enabling schemaless and structureless graph querying (SLQ), where a user need not describe queries precisely as required by most databases. The query engine is built on a set of transformation functions that automatically map keywords and linkages from a query to their matches in a graph. It automatically learns an effective ranking model, without assuming manually labeled training examples, and can efficiently return top ranked matches using graph sketch and belief propagation. The architecture of SLQ is elastic for plug-in new transformation functions and query logs. Our experimental results show that this new graph querying paradigm is promising: It identifies high-quality matches for both keyword and graph queries over real-life knowledge graphs, and outperforms existing methods significantly in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."

However, this may not be the best solution since they do not consider the ubiquitous existences of Transient Connected Components (TCCs), where nodes inside a TCC can reach each other by multi-hop wireless communications. In this paper, we first identify the existence of TCCs and analyze their properties based on five real traces. Then, we propose TCC-aware data forwarding strategies which exploit the special characteristics of TCCs to increase the contact opportunities and then improve the performance of data forwarding. Trace-driven simulations show that our TCC-aware data forwarding strategies outperform existing data forwarding strategies in terms of data delivery ratio and network overhead."

        "abstract": "In cognitive radio networks, unlicensed users can use under-utilized licensed spectrum to achieve substantial performance improvement. To avoid interference with licensed users, unlicensed users must vacate the spectrum when it is accessed by licensed users. Since it takes some time for unlicensed users to switch to other available channels, the ongoing data transmissions may have to be interrupted and the transmission delay can be significantly increased. This makes it hard for cognitive radio networks to meet the delay constraints of many applications. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use caching techniques to address this problem. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem, which is to minimize the caching cost subject to some delay constraint. To solve this problem, we propose three approaches: cost-based, delay-based, and hybrid. Simulation results show that our approaches outperform existing caching solutions in terms of caching cost and delay constraint."

In this paper, we propose to reduce the tail energy by aggregating the data traffic of multiple nodes using their P2P interfaces. This traffic aggregation problem is formalized as finding the best task schedule to minimize energy. We first propose a A* algorithm, which can reduce the search space for finding the optimal schedule offline, and then introduce an online traffic aggregation algorithm. We have implemented the online traffic aggregation on Android smartphones, and build a small testbed. Experimental results and trace-driven simulations show that our traffic aggregation algorithm can significantly reduce the energy and delay."

        "abstract": "Human mobility is a complex pattern of movements and activities that are based on some\nunderlying semantics of human behavior. In order to construct accurate models of human mobility,\nthis semantic behavior needs to be unearthed from the data sensed as a human being moves around\nand visits certain classes of locations such as home, work, mall, theater, restaurant etc. The ideal\ndata for understanding the semantics of mobility would constitute timestamped mobility traces with\ndetailed geographic locations with annotations about the type of each location. One way of achieving\nthis is by following a hybrid strategy of participatory sensing (with each person carrying a wireless\nsensor device) and deploying static sensors at each location of interest  the contacts between the\nmobile and (annotated) static sensors can be logged at each location, and then collated to form an appropriate\nmobility traces. For example, a person can connect with his mobile phone over Bluetooth or\nWiFi to a local hotspot while checking into FourSquare at a restaurant. In the absence of static sensors,\na person may manually annotate the places he visits on his device over time. However, most mobility\ntraces consist of network connectivity data from cell phones (e.g., contact with towers) which lack\ndetailed geographic locations and are ambiguous, noisy and unlabeled. Thus, it is important to extract\nthe semantics of mobility that is latent in the available contact traces. To this end, we propose in this\npaper the concept of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Trajectories (PLST), an unsupervised approach\nto extract semantically different locations and sequential patterns of mobility from such traces. PLST\nextracts semantic locations as contextually co-occurring network elements (cell towers and Bluetooth\ndevices) and models the behavior of their sequence. PLST extracts distinct locations with spatial,\ntemporal and semantic coherency and can be used for accurate prediction of the next place a user\nvisits. PLST also analyzes the complexity of mobility traces using information theoretic metrics\nto study the underlying structure and semantic content in mobility traces. This semantic content\ncan be extracted allowing us to investigate mobility patterns in a completely unsupervised manner."

However, correlations are affected by both direct and indirect paths, confounding our ability to identify true pairwise interactions. Here we exploit the fundamental properties of dynamical correlations in networks to develop a method to silence indirect effects. The method receives as input the observed correlations between node pairs and uses a matrix transformation to turn the correlation matrix into a highly discriminative silenced matrix, which enhances only the terms associated with direct causal links. Against empirical data for Escherichia coli regulatory interactions, the method enhanced the discriminative power of the correlations by twofold, yielding >50% predictive improvement over traditional correlation measures and 6% over mutual information. Overall this silencing method will help translate the abundant correlation data into insights about a systems interactions, with applications ranging from link prediction to inferring the dynamical mechanisms governing biological networks."

        "abstract": "Controlling complex systems is a fundamental challenge of network science. Recent advances indicate that control over the system can be achieved through a minimum driver node set (MDS). The existence of multiple MDSs suggests that nodes do not participate in control equally, prompting us to quantify their participations. Here we introduce control capacity quantifying the likelihood that a node is a driver node. To efficiently measure this quantity, we develop a random sampling algorithm. This algorithm not only provides a statistical estimate of the control capacity, but also bridges the gap between multiple microscopic control configurations and macroscopic properties of the network under control. We demonstrate that the possibility of being a driver node decreases with a nodes in-degree and is independent of its out-degree. Given the inherent multiplicity of MDSs, our findings offer tools to explore control in various complex systems."

Here we develop a self-consistent theory of dynamical perturbations in complex systems, allowing us to systematically separate the contribution of the network topology and dynamics. The formalism covers a broad range of steady-state dynamical processes and offers testable predictions regarding the systems response to perturbations and the development of correlations. It predicts several distinct universality classes whose characteristics can be derived directly from the continuum equation governing the systems dynamics and which are validated on several canonical network-based dynamical systems, from biochemical dynamics to epidemic spreading. Finally, we collect experimental data pertaining to social and biological systems, demonstrating that we can accurately uncover their universality class even in the absence of an appropriate continuum theory that governs the systems dynamics."

Previous studies ignored the effect that a node outside the percolating cluster may actively induce its inside neighbours to exit the percolating cluster. Here we study this inducing effect on the classical site percolation and K-core percolation, showing that the inducing effect always causes a discontinuous percolation transition. We precisely predict the percolation threshold and core size for uncorrelated random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. For low-dimensional lattices the percolation threshold fluctuates considerably over realizations, yet we can still predict the core size once the percolation occurs. The core sizes of real-world networks can also be well predicted using degree distribution as the only input. Our work therefore provides a theoretical framework for quantitatively understanding discontinuous breakdown phenomena in various complex systems."

Various microscopic processes have been incorporated in these models, among them, node and edge addition, vertex fitness and the deletion of nodes and edges. The existing models, however, focus on specific combinations of these processes and parameterize them in a way that makes it difficult to elucidate the role of the individual elementary mechanisms. We therefore formulated and solved a model that incorporates the minimal processes governing network evolution. Some contribute to growth such as the formation of connections between existing pair of vertices, while others capture deletion; the removal of a node with its corresponding edges, or the removal of an edge between a pair of vertices. We distinguish between these elementary mechanisms, identifying their specific role on network evolution."

Our results show that mobile phone based social interaction patterns can provide more predictive power on spending behavior than personality based\nfeatures. Interestingly, we find that more social couples also tend to overspend.

        "abstract": "Leaders are important for the smooth functioning of teams but their effect on team performance is less well estab-lished. Based on a sample of 55 software development teams from two companies we examined the association between technical leaders communication structure and the teams performance. Consistent with past research, we found that a teams productivity and quality improve when the team communication follows hierarchical and small-world patterns, respectively. However, there was significant additional improvement in both productivity and quality when technical leaders shared more information than they gathered, and when they were more central in the commu-nication network. Surprisingly they were not necessarily the most *central* individuals in the team's communication structure. We discuss the implication of these results for new tools that provide feedback to leaders and the team."

        "abstract": "In recent years, evolving mobile application market and mobile commerce has driven smartphone adoption. The goal of this paper is to answer two fundamental questions: What are the switching trends for smartphones? And how can we estimate the demand for new smartphones? We answer these two questions by collecting a phone-switching dataset of 3 million subscribers from a nationwide telecom operator. The first question produces interesting results: for example, 90% of subscribers who are both young and have high income prefer smartphones while 65% of subscribers who are both old and have low income like to use them. Moreover, 70% of subscribers in a business bill plan prefer the phone used by their business partners. For the second question, we build classifiers using Bayesian Networks to infer subscribers next phone choices. Compared with the existing methods, our classifiers reduce the prediction error by 1/3 and related costs by half. Our approach helps the telecom operator forecast the inventory more accurately and reduce financial loss due to an inaccurate prediction."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of predicting personality with fea- tures based on social behavior. While network position and text analysis are often used in personality prediction, the use of social behavior is fairly new. Often stud- ies of social behavior either concentrate on a single behavior or trait, or simply use behavior to predict ties that are then used in analysis of network position. To study this problem, we introduce novel features based on a persons social actions in general, a towards specific individuals in particular. We also compute the variation of these actions among all the social contacts of a person as well as the actions of friends. We show that social behavior alone, without the help of any textual or network position information, provides a good basis for personality prediction. We then provide a unique comparative study that finds the most signif- icant features based on social behavior in predicting personality for three different communication mediums: Twitter, SMS and phone calls. These mediums offer us with social behavior from public and private contexts, containing messaging and voice call type exchanges. We find behaviors that are distinctive and normative among the ones we study. We also illustrate how behavioral features relate to different personality traits. We also show the various similarities and differences between different mediums in terms of social behavior. Note that all behavioral features are based on statistical properties of the number and the time of social actions and do not consider the textual content. As a result, they can be applied in many different settings. Furthermore, our findings show us how behavioral features can be customized to a specific medium and personality trait."

An actor has high betweenness if it lies on many shortest paths; and, high closeness if it is close to other actors and hence can quickly broadcast information. Both measures are based on an information flow model that\n(i) only sends information along shortest paths, ignoring the advantages offered by alternate almost shortest paths;\n(ii) assumes the important actors can attend to all the information flow through each of the (many) shortest paths that might use the actor.\nWe develop two new measures attentive betweenness centrality (ABC) and attentive closeness centrality (ACC) to address these issues. Our measures capture the essential properties of closeness and betweenness and are just as efficient to compute. However, our measures respect that an actors attention must be split among the information flows that pass through the actor; and, these information flows need not be constrained to shortest paths. In our experiments on stylized and large scale real networks, our new centrality measures emerge as the most accurate, when compared with the classical measures using external metrics of prominence."

Several years ago, it was\nshown that adding nodes as well as edges to the graph can yield an\ninfinite order transition, which is much smoother than the traditional\nsecond order transition.  More recently, it was shown that adding\nedges via a competitive process to a fixed set of initially isolated\nnodes can lead to a delayed, extremely abrupt percolation transition\nwith a significant jump in large but finite systems.  Here we analyze\na process that combines both node arrival and edge competition.  If\nstarted from a small collection of seed nodes, we show that the impact\nof node arrival dominates: although we can significantly delay\npercolation, the transition is of infinite order.  Thus, node arrival\ncan mitigate the trade-off between delay and abruptness that is\ncharacteristic of explosive percolation transitions.  This realization\nmay inspire new design rules where network growth can temper the\neffects of delay, creating opportunities for network intervention and\ncontrol."

        "abstract": "The location and nature of the percolation transition in random networks is a subject of intense interest. Recently, a series of graph evolution processes have been introduced that lead to discontinuous percolation transitions where the addition of a single edge causes the size of the largest component to exhibit a significant macroscopic jump in the thermodynamic limit. These processes can have additional exotic behaviors, such as displaying a ``Devil's staircase* of discrete jumps in the supercritical regime. Here we investigate whether the location of the largest jump coincides with the percolation threshold for a range of processes, such as \\\\ER~percolation, percolation via edge competition and via growth by overtaking. We find that the largest jump asymptotically occurs at the percolation transition for \\\\ER~and other processes exhibiting global continuity, including models exhibiting an `explosive' transition. However, for percolation processes exhibiting genuine discontinuities, the behavior is substantially richer. In percolation models where the order parameter exhibits a staircase, the largest discontinuity generically does not coincide with the percolation transition. For the generalized Bohman-Frieze-Wormald model, it depends on the model parameter. Distinct parameter regimes well in the supercritical regime feature unstable discontinuous transitions---a novel and unexpected phenomenon in percolation. We thus demonstrate that seemingly and genuinely discontinuous percolation transitions can involve a rich behavior in supercriticality, a regime that has been largely ignored in percolation."

We adopt a directed hypergraph model of the problem and establish the NP-completeness of the problem in 2-D networks. We then develop two polynomial-time approximation algorithms for general directed hypergraphs (which can model non-isomorphic signal propagation in space) and for ring hypergraphs (which result from isomorphic signal propagation). We also consider the thinnest path problem in 1-D networks and 1-D networks embedded in 2-D field of eavesdroppers with arbitrary unknown locations (the so-called 1.5-D networks). We propose a linear-complexity algorithm based on nested backward induction that obtains the optimal solution to both 1-D and 1.5-D networks. This algorithm does not require the knowledge of eavesdropper locations and achieves the best performance offered by any algorithm that assumes complete location information of the eavesdroppers."

We show that for the data-aware case, both T-graph\nsampling and smashing problems are NP-hard, but they are\namenable to reasonably good approximations. We also show\nthat for the probabilistic setting where each graphlet in a\nT-graph is an Erdos-Renyi random graph, sampling yields\na loose lower bound for the T-reachable set, while different\nstyles of smashing yield more useful upper and lower\nbounds. Finally, we show that our algorithms (both dataaware\nand data-oblivious) can estimate the T-reachable set\nin real world time-varying networks within reasonable accuracy\nusing less than 0.5% of the number of graphlets."

For million-node networks, our method retrieves the exact top 20 neighbors using less than 0.2% of the network edges in a fraction of a second on a conventional desktop machine. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our proximity measure and NN search for three applications, namely (i) finding good local clusters, (ii) network sparsification and (iii) prediction of node attributes in information networks. The EI measure and NN search method outperform recent counterparts from the literature in all applications"

        "abstract": "Online dating sites have become popular platforms for people to look for potential romantic partners. It is important to understand users dating preferences in order to make better recommendations on potential dates. The message sending and replying actions of a user are strong indicators for what he/she is looking for in a potential date and reflect the users actual dating preferences. We study how users online dating behaviors correlate with various user attributes using a large real-world dateset from a major online dating site in China. Many of our results on user messaging behavior align with notions in social and evolutionary psychology: males tend to look for younger females while females put more emphasis on the socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education level) of a potential date. In addition, we observe that the geographic distance between two users and the photo count of users play an important role in their dating behaviors.  Our results show that it is important to differentiate between users true preferences and random selection. Some user behaviors in choosing attributes in a potential date may largely be a result of random selection. We also find that\nboth males and females are more likely to reply to users whose attributes come closest to the stated preferences of\nthe receivers, and there is significant discrepancy between a users stated dating preference and his/her actual online\ndating behavior. These results can provide valuable guidelines to the design of a recommendation engine for potential\ndates."

        "abstract": "Wikification, commonly referred to as Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W), is the task of identifying concepts and entities in text and disambiguating them into the most specific corresponding Wikipedia pages. Previous approaches to D2W focused on the use of local and global statistics over the given text, Wikipedia articles and its link structures, to evaluate context compatibility among a list of probable candidates. However, these methods fail (often, embarrassingly), when some level of text understanding is needed to support Wikification. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to Wikification by incorporating, along with statistical methods, richer relational analysis of the text. We provide an extensible, efficient and modular Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of Wikification that incorporates the entity-relation inference problem, and show that the ability to identify relations in text helps both candidate generation and ranking Wikipedia titles considerably. Our results show significant improvements in both Wikification and the TAC Entity Linking task."

        "abstract": "A digital data collection (e.g., scientific publications, enterprise reports, news, and social media) can often be modeled as a heterogeneous information network, linking text with multiple types of entities. Constructing high-quality concept hierarchies that can represent topics at multiple granularities benefits tasks such as search, information browsing, and pattern mining. In this work we present an algorithm for recursively constructing multi-typed topical hierarchies. Contrary to traditional text-based topic modeling, our approach handles both textual phrases and multiple types of entities by a newly designed clustering and ranking algorithm for heterogeneous network data, as well as mining and ranking topical patterns of different types. Our experiments on datasets from two different domains demonstrate that our algorithm yields high quality, multi-typed topical hierarchies."

However, most such studies only consider a single type of relationship, e.g.,\nsocial network. Notice that in many applications, the recommendation problem exists in an attribute-rich heterogeneous information\nnetwork environment. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. We\npropose to combine various relationship information from the network with user feedback to provide high quality recommendation\nresults. Themajor challenge of building recommender systems in heterogeneous information networks is to systematically define features to represent the different types of relationships between entities, and learn the importance of each relationship type. In the proposed framework, we first use meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different paths in the related information network. We then define a recommendation model with such latent features and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the model. Empirical studies show that our approach outperforms several widely employed implicit feedback entity recommendation techniques."

We consider extant models of triadic evolution  emphasizing vertex, dyadic, triadic and higher-level processes  to generate testable predictions as to the determinants of both triangle stability and triangle emergence in social networks.  We find that the stability and formation of triangles is affected by processes and mechanisms operating at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously. Nevertheless, dyadic mechanisms related to strength and reciprocity and triadic processes associated with coherence in edge-weights are preponderant in their substantive effects even after adjusting for factors at lower and higher levels of aggregation.\n"

Nowadays the massive size of some critical networks  often stored in already overloaded relational databases  effectively limits the rate at which nodes and edges can be explored, making it a challenge to accurately discover subgraph statistics. In this work, we propose sampling methods to accurately estimate subgraph statistics from as few queried nodes as possible. We present sampling algorithms that efficiently and accurately estimate subgraph properties of massive networks. Our algorithms require no pre-computation or complete network topology information. At the same time, we provide theoretical guarantees of convergence. We perform experiments using widely known data sets, and show that for the same accuracy, our algorithms require an order of magnitude less queries (samples) than the current state-of-the-art algorithms."

        "abstract": "Driven by outstanding success stories of Internet startups such as Facebook and The Hungton Post, recent studies have thoroughly described their growth. These highly visible online success stories, however, overshadow an untold number of similar ventures that fail. The study of website popularity is ultimately incomplete without general mechanisms that can describe both successes and failures. In this work we present six years of the daily number of users (DAU) of twenty-two membership-based websites  encompassing online social networks, grassroots movements, online forums, and membership-only Internet stores  well balanced between successes and failures. We then propose a combination of reaction-diusion-decay processes whose resulting equations seem not only to describe well the observed DAU time series but also provide means to roughly predict its evolution. This model also provides means for an automatic DAU-based classication of websites into self- sustainable v.s. unsustainable, possibly uncovering whether the startup growth was mostly driven by marketing & media campaigns or word-of-mouth adoptions.

        "abstract": "Long gone is the time when malware spread through infected floppy disks. Today, online social networks offer a medium of propagation that is writing a new chapter in the evolution of computer malware. Unlike other forms of malware, online social network malware blurs the frontier between psychology, applied mathematics, and computer security. Exploiting social and monetary psychological incentives, this new form of malware directs users to malicious websites that hijack their accounts and trigger word-of-mouth infections among their friends. These word-of-mouth infections cascade through the network compromising thousands of accounts. In this work, we monitor 3.5 million Facebook accounts and explore the role of pure monetary, social, and combined socio-monetary incentives in malware campaigns. Among other findings, we see that campaigns with combined socio-monetary incentives infect more accounts and last longer than campaigns with pure monetary or social incentives. The latter unveils a surprising new potential connection between computer malware, psychology, and biological pathogens."

This question extends across many production settings but is of long-standing interest in science and innovation, where the Matthew Effect suggests that eminent team members garner credit for great works at the expense of less eminent team members.  In this paper, we study this question in reverse, examining highly negative events -- article retractions.  Using the Web of Science, we investigate how retractions affect trust in an authors prior work as measured by citations to the authors prior publications. We find that the Matthew Effect works in reverse  namely, scientific misconduct imposes little citation penalty on eminent coauthors. By contrast, less eminent coauthors face substantial citation declines to their prior work, and especially when they are teamed with an eminent author. A simple Bayesian model is used to interpret the results. These findings suggest that a good reputation can have protective properties, but at the expense of those with less established reputations."

        "abstract": "A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical (i.e., sensor) devices with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a context sensitive system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in real-world situations. The CPS has wide applications in scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is called mining lines in the sand. With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a designated area, the CPS is required to discover all the trajectories (lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy; (2) the intruders do not send out any identification information. The system needs to distinguish multiple intruders and track their movements. In this study, we propose a method called LiSM (Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover trajectories from untrustworthy sensor data. LiSM constructs a watching network from sensor data and computes the locations of intruder appearances based on the link information of the network. The system retrieves a cone-model from the historical trajectories and tracks multiple intruders based on this model. Finally the system validates the mining results and updates the sensors reliability in a feedback process. Extensive experiments on big datasets demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods."

        "abstract": "Risks threatening modern societies form an intricately interconnected network that often underlies crisis situations. Yet, little is known about how risk materializations in distinct domains influence each other. Here we present an approach in which expert assessments of risks likelihoods and influence underlie a quantitative model of the global risk network dynamics. The modeled risks range from environmental to economic and technological and include difficult to quantify risks, such as geo-political or social. Using the maximum likelihood estimation, we find the optimal model parameters and demonstrate that the model including network effects significantly outperforms the others, uncovering full value of the expert collected data. We analyze the model dynamics and study its resilience and stability. Our findings include such risk properties as contagion potential, persistence, roles in cascades of failures and the identity of risks most detrimental to system stability. The model provides quantitative means for measuring the adverse effects of risk interdependence and the materialization of risks in the network."

On one hand, location and time data enable novel applications and services to the common man (e.g., smarter cities, smarter telcos). On the other hand, such information can result in serious privacy breaches (e.g., pleaserobme.com). In this talk, I will examine the implications of availability of large volumes of spatiotemporal data on privacy. I will present observations from our past work on the privacy analysis of spatiotemporal data, examining various techniques to obfuscate such data to achieve privacy at a community-wide level and also examining techniques that break the privacy based on different channels of information (e.g., text, maps). Finally, I will also discuss a system that we are currently building that can ingest large volumes of data and analyze it in real-time to infer motion behavioral patterns."

Unlike graphs, hypergraphs can capture higher-order interactions in social and communication networks that go beyond a simple union of pairwise  relationships. In this paper, we consider the shortest path problem in hypergraphs. We develop two algorithms for finding and maintaining the shortest hyperpaths in a dynamic network with both weight and topological changes. These two algorithms are the first addressing the fully dynamic shortest path problem in a general hypergraph. They complement each other by partitioning the application space based on the nature of the change dynamics and the type of the hypergraph. We analyz e\nthe time complexity of the proposed algorithms and perform simulation experiments for both random geometric hypergraphs\nand the Enron email data set. The latter illustrates the application of the proposed algorithms in social networks for identifying the most important actor based on the closeness centrality metric."

The objective is to minimize the total cost of the network-wide broadcast, where the cost can be of any form that is summable over all the transmissions (e.g., the transmission and reception energy, the price for accessing a specific channel). Our technical approach is based on a simplicial complex model that allows us to capture the broadcast nature of the wireless medium and the heterogeneity across radios and channels. Specifically, we show that broadcasting in multi-radio multi-channel ad hoc networks can be formulated as a minimum spanning problem in simplicial complexes. We establish the NP-completeness of the minimum spanning problem and propose two approximation algorithms with order-optimal performance guarantee. The first approximation algorithm converts the minimum spanning problem in simplical complexes to a minimum connected set cover problem. The second algorithm converts it to a node-weighted Steiner tree problem under the classic graph model . These two algorithms offer tradeoffs between performance and time-complexity. In a broader cont ext, this work appears to be the first that studies the minimum spanning problem in simplicial complex es and weighted minimum connected set cover problem."

An experiment is conducted to explore information analysts' interactions with recommendations from an automated fact-finder algorithm, during the task of answering questions in a humanitarian aid delivery scenario.  Our experiment (N=285) is performed using three increasingly complex user interfaces, with and without the presence of the automated recommendations.

We apply a gossip-based approach to\nDTNs and show that it exhibits a phase transition property for\ndelivery ratio: for some values of gossip probabilities and packet\nlifetimes the delivery ratio is very low and hardly any nodes\nreceive the packet; for the remaining gossip probabilities and\npacket lifetimes, the delivery ratio is at its highest and a large\nfraction of the nodes receive the packet. The phase transition\nthresholds correspond to minimum network transmissions while\nproviding the highest possible delivery ratio. We present\nDisrupted Adaptive Routing (DAR), a gossip-based DTN routing\nprotocol, that exploits this phase transition property and develops\nan adaptive algorithm to compute gossip probabilities based on\nthe phase transition thresholds in random networks.\nFurthermore, we augment DAR with a mechanism that trades off\na small packet metadata with the summary vector exchange of\nthe epidemic protocol, thereby reducing the network\ntransmissions even more. We present experimental results that\nshow that DAR outperforms the traditional epidemic routing\nprotocol by 76% in terms of network transmissions while\nproviding 27% improved delivery ratio and 18% lower average\npacket delay."

        "abstract": "Twitter is presently utilized as a channel of com- munication and information dissemination. At present, govern- ment and non-government emergency management organizations utilize Twitter to disseminate emergency relevant information. However, these organizations have limited ability to evaluate the Twitter communication in order to discover communication patterns, key players, and messages that are being propagated through Twitter regarding the event. More importantly there is a general lack of knowledge of who are the individuals or organizations that disseminate warning information, provide confirmations of an event and associated actions, and urge others to take action. This paper presents a methodology that shows how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Social Network Analysis (SNA) can aid in addressing these issues. The methodology, in addition to qualitative data collected during on-site interviews and publicly available information, was successfully applied to a Twitter data set collected during 2011 Japan tsunami. NLP tech- niques were applied to extract actionable messages. Based on the messages extracted by NLP, SNA was used to construct a network of actionable messages. While SNA discovered communities and extracted the community leaders, NLP was used to determine the behavior of the community members and the role of the community leaders. Therefore, the proposed methodology auto- matically finds communities, evaluates its members behaviors, and authenticates cohesive behaviors of the community members during emergencies. Moreover, the methodology efficiently finds the leaders of the communities, while also identifying their role in communities.\n"

        "abstract": "The widespread use of road sensors has generated huge  amount of traffic data, which can be mined and put to various different uses. Finding frequent trajectories from the road network of a big city helps in summarizing the way the traffic behaves in the city. It can be very useful in city planning and traffic routing mechanisms, and may be used to suggest the best routes given the region, road, time of day, day of week, season, weather, and events etc. Other than the frequent patterns, even the events that are not so frequent, such as those observed when there is heavy snowfall, other extreme weather conditions, long traffic jams, accidents, etc. might actually follow a periodic occurrence, and hence might be useful to mine. This problem of mining the frequent patterns from road traffic data has been \naddressed in previous works using the context knowledge of the road network of the city. In this paper, we have developed a method to mine spatiotemporal periodic patterns in the traffic data and use these periodic behaviors to summarize the huge road network. The first step is to find periodic patterns from the speed data of individual road sensor stations, and use their periods to represent the station's periodic behavior using probability distribution matrices. Then, we use density-based clustering to cluster the sensors on the road network based on the similarities between their periodic behavior as well as their geographical distance, thus combining similar nodes to form a road network with larger but fewer nodes. \n"

        "abstract": "As spatiotemporal data becomes widely available, mining and understanding such data have gained a lot of attention recently. Among all important patterns, periodicity is arguably the most frequently happening one for moving objects. Finding periodic behaviors is essential to understanding the activities of objects, and to predict future movements and detect anomalies in trajectories. However, periodic behaviors in spatiotemporal data could be complicated, involving multiple interleaving periods, partial time span, and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. Even worse, due to the limitations of positioning technology or its various kinds of deployments,\nreal movement data is often highly incomplete and sparse. In this chapter, we discuss existing techniques to mine periodic behaviors from spatiotemporal data, with a focus on tackling the aforementioned difficulties risen in real applications. In particular, we first review the traditional time-series method for periodicity detection. Then, a novel method specifically designed to mine periodic behaviors in spatiotemporal data, Periodica, is introduced. Periodica proposes to use reference spots to observe movement and detect periodicity from the in-and-out binary sequence. Then, we discuss the important issue of dealing with sparse and incomplete observations in spatiotemporal data, and propose a new general framework Periodo to detect periodicity for temporal events despite such nuisances. We provide experiment results on real movement data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. While\nthese techniques are developed in the context of spatiotemporal data mining, we believe that they are very general and could benefit researchers and practitioners from other related fields."

These applications deal with lot of personal information, e.g., identity and location. Therefore, we need to pay a deeper attention to privacy and anonymity. However, the knowledge of the data source is desired to evaluate the trustworthiness of the sensing data. Anonymity and trust become two conflicting objectives in mobile sensing. In this paper, we propose ARTSense, a framework to solve the problem of *trust without identity* in mobile sensing. Our solution consists of a privacy-preserving provenance model, a data trust assessment scheme and an anonymous reputation management protocol. In contrast to other recent solutions, our scheme does not require a trusted third party and both positive and negative reputation updates can be enforced. In the trust assessment, we consider contextual factors that dynamically affects the trustworthiness of the sensing data as well as the mutual support and conflict among data from difference sources. Security analysis shows that ARTSense achieves our desired anonymity and security goals. Our prototype implementation on Android demonstrates that ARTSense incurs minimal computation overhead on mobile devices, and simulation results justify that ARTSense captures the trust of information and reputation of participants accurately."

Experiments on the case study of slot filling demonstrate that our approach can find truths accurately (11.06% higher accuracy than supervised methods) and efficiently (finding 90% truths with only one half cost of a baseline without credibility estimation).

        "abstract": "Wikification for tweets aims to automatically identify each concept mention in a tweet and link it to a concept referent in a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia). Due to the shortness of a tweet, a collective inference model incorporating global evidence from multiple mentions and concepts is more appropriate than a non-collecitve approach which links each mention at a time. In addition, it is challenging to generate sufficient high quality labeled data for supervised models with low costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised graph regularization model to incorporate both local and global evidence from multiple tweets through three fine-grained relations. In order to identify semantically-related mentions for collective inference, we detect meta path-based semantic relations through social networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art supervised model trained from 100% labeled data, our proposed approach achieves comparable performance with 31% labeled data and obtains 5% absolute F1 gain with 50% labeled\ndata."

As such, the notion of interacting multiple networks or composite networks is gaining popularity. In this paper, we present a first-of-a-kind framework to analyze such composite networks in an efficient and scalable manner. We propose to use the BSP programming model to analyze composite networks and show the inportance of analyzing such composite networks as opposed to individual networks separately through preliminary experiments on real- world data."

        "abstract": "Probabilistic model-based clustering techniques have been widely used and have shown promising results in many applications, ranging from image segmentation [71, 15], handwriting recognition [60], document clustering [36, 81], topic modeling [35, 14] to information retrieval [43]. Model-based clustering approaches attempt to optimize the t between the observed data and some mathematical model using a probabilistic approach. Such methods are often based on the assumption that the data are generated by a mixture of underlying probability distributions. In practice, each cluster can be represented mathematically by a parametric probability distribution, such as a\nGaussian or a Poisson distribution. Thus, the clustering problem is transformed into a parameter estimation problem since the entire data can be modeled by a mixture of K component distributions.Data points (or objects) that belong most likely to the same distribution can then easily be dened as clusters.\nIn this chapter, we introduce several fundamental models and algorithms for probabilistic clustering, including mixture models[45, 48, 25], EM algorithm[23, 46, 53, 16], and probabilistic topic models [35, 14]. For each probabilistic model, we will introduce its general framework of modeling, the probabilistic explanation, the standard algorithms to learn the model, and its applications. Mixture models are probabilistic models which are increasingly used to nd the clusters for univariate and multivariate data. We therefore begin our discussion of mixture models in Section 3.2, in which the values of the discrete latent variables can be interpreted as the assignments of data points to specic components (i.e., clusters) of the mixture. To nd maximum likelihood estimations in mixture models, a general and elegant technique, the Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm, is introduced in Section 3.3. We rst use the Gaussian mixture model to motivate the EM algorithm in an informal way, and then give a more general view of the EM algorithm, which is a standard learning algorithm for many probabilistic models. In Section 3.4, we present two popular probabilistic topic models, i.e., probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) [35] and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [14], for documentclustering and analysis. Note that some of the methods(e.g., EM/mixture models) may be more appropriate for quantitative data, whereas others such as topic models, PLSI, and LDA, are used more commonly for text data. Finally, we give the conclusions and summary in\nSection 3.5.\n"

        "abstract": "In the real world, various systems can be modeled using heterogeneous networks which consist of entities of different types. Many problems on such networks can be mapped to an underlying critical problem of discovering top-K subgraphs of entities with rare and surprising associations. Answering such subgraph queries efficiently involves two main challenges: (1) computing all matching subgraphs which satisfy the query and (2) ranking such results based on the rarity and the interestingness of the associations among entities in the subgraphs. Previous work on the matching problem can be harnessed for a nave ranking-after-matching solution. However, for large graphs, subgraph queries may have enormous number of matches, and so it is inefficient to compute all matches\nwhen only the top-K matches are desired. In this paper, we address the two challenges of matching and ranking in top-K\nsubgraph discovery as follows. First, we introduce two index structures for the network: topology index, and graph maximum\nmetapath weight index, which are both computed offline. Second, we propose novel top-K mechanisms to exploit these indexes\nfor answering interesting subgraph queries online efficiently. Experimental results on several synthetic datasets and the DBLP\nand Wikipedia datasets containing thousands of entities show the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed approach in\ncomputing interesting subgraphs."

However,\nstate-of-the-art intent learning algorithms suffer from different drawbacks when only using a single type of data\nsource. For example, query text has difficulty in distinguishing ambiguous queries; search log is bias to the order of\nsearch results and users noisy click behaviors. In this work, we for the first time leverage three types of objects, namely\nqueries, web pages and Wikipedia concepts collaboratively for learning generic search intents and construct a heterogeneous\ngraph to represent multiple types of relationships between them. A novel unsupervised method called hetero-\ngeneous graph-based soft-clustering is developed to derive an intent indicator for each object based on the constructed heterogeneous\ngraph. With the proposed co-clustering method, one can enhance the quality of intent understanding by taking\nadvantage of different types of data, which complement each other, and make the implicit intents easier to interpret\nwith explicit knowledge from Wikipedia concepts. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the power of\nthe proposed method where it achieves a 9.25% improvement in terms of NDCG on search ranking task and a 4.67%\nenhancement in terms of Rand index on object co-clustering task compared to the best state-of-the-art method."

For example, vertical search engines, such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Yelp\nand Yahoo! Local, provide business category hierarchies for people to navigate through millions of business listings. The\ncategory information also provides important ranking features that can be used to improve search experience. However,\ncategory hierarchies are often manually crafted by some human experts and they are far from complete. Manually\nconstructed category hierarchies cannot handle the ever-changing and sometimes long-tail user information needs.\nIn this paper, we study the problem of how to expand an existing category hierarchy for a search/navigation system\nto accommodate the information needs of users more comprehensively. We propose a general framework for this task,\nwhich has three steps: 1) detecting meaningful missing categories; 2) modeling the category hierarchy using a hierarchical\nDirichlet model and predicting the optimal tree structure according to the model; 3) reorganizing the corpus using the\ncomplete category structure, i.e., associating each webpage with the relevant categories from the complete category hierarchy.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework generates a high-quality category hierarchy and\nsignificantly boosts the retrieval performance."

Specifically, a user may want to identify suspicious\nsubgraphs matching a query template. A subgraph can be defined as anomalous based on the connectivity structure\nwithin itself as well as with its neighborhood. For example for a co-authorship network, given a subgraph containing\nthree authors, one expects all three authors to be say data mining authors. Also, one expects the neighborhood\nto mostly consist of data mining authors. But a 3-author clique of data mining authors with all theory authors in the\nneighborhood clearly seems interesting. Similarly, having one of the authors in the clique as a theory author when all\nother authors (both in the clique and neighborhood) are data mining authors, is also suspicious. Thus, existence of lowprobability\nlinks and absence of high-probability links can be a good indicator of subgraph outlierness. The probability\nof an edge can in turn be modeled based on the weighted similarity between the attribute values of the nodes linked by\nthe edge. We claim that the attribute weights must be learned locally for accurate link existence probability computations.\nIn this paper, we design a system that finds subgraph outliers given a graph and a query by modeling the problem as a linear\noptimization.

Often, however, only a relatively small set of nodes have a known infection state. Moreover, the length of time that each node has been infected is also unknown. This miss- ing data  infection state of most nodes and infection time of the unobserved infected nodes poses a challenge to the study of real-world cascades.\nIn this work, we develop techniques to identify the latent infected nodes in the presence of missing infection time-and-state data. Based on the likely epidemic paths predicted by the simple susceptible-infected epidemic model, we propose a measure (Infection Betweenness) for uncovering these unknown infection states. Our experimental results using machine learning algorithms show that Infection Betweenness is the most effective feature for identifying latent infected nodes."

Experimental results using data from a large online dating website shows that two-sided matching improves significantly the rate of successful matches by as much as 45%. Finally, using simulated matchings we show that the the LDA model can correctly capture user preferences."

Trust is a complex concept studied by disciplines like psychology, sociology, economics, and computer science. Definitions of trust vary depending on the context, but are typically based on the core concept of reliance on another person or entity. Trust is a critical concept since the presence or absence of the right level of trust can affect user behavior, and ultimately, the overall system performance. In this paper, we look across four studies to explore the relationship between UI elements and human trust behavior. Results indicate that UI com-position and information presentation can impact human trust behavior. While further research is required to corroborate and generalize these results, we hope that this paper will provide a reference point for future studies by identifying UI elements that are likely to influence human trust."

        "abstract": "The explosive growth in social networks that publish real-time content begs the question of whether their feeds can complement traditional sensors to achieve augmented sensing capabilities. One such capability is to explain anomalous sensor readings. Towards that end, in this paper, we build an automated anomaly clarification service, called ClariSense. It explains sensor anomalies using social network feeds. Explanation goes beyond detection. When a sensor network detects anomalous conditions, our system automatically suggests hypotheses that explain the likely causes of the anomaly to a human by identifying unusual social network feeds that seem to be correlated with the sensor anomaly in time and in space. To evaluate this service, we use real-time data feeds from the California traffic system that shares vehicle count and traffic speed on major California highways at 5 minute intervals. When anomalies are detected, our system automatically diagnoses their root cause by correlating the anomaly with feeds on Twitter. The identified cause is then compared to official traffic and incident reports, showing a great correspondence with ground truth.\n"

        "abstract": "Signal feature extraction and classification are two common tasks in signal processing literature. This paper investigates use of source identities as a common mechanism for enhancing the classification accuracy of social signals. We define social signals as outputs, such as microblog entries, geotags, or uploaded images, contributed by users in a social network. Many classification tasks can be defined on such outputs. For example, one may want to identify the dialect of a microblog contributed by an author, or classify information referred to in a users tweet as true or false. While the design of such classifiers is application-specific, social signals share in common one key property: they are augmented by the explicit identity of the source. This motivates investigating whether or not knowing the source of each signal (in addition to exploiting signal features) allows the classification accuracy to be improved. We call it provenance-assisted classification. This paper answers the above question affirmatively, demonstrating how source identities can\nimprove classification accuracy, and derives confidence bounds to quantify the accuracy of results. Evaluation is performed in\ntwo real-world contexts: (i) fact-finding that classifies microblog entries into true and false, and (ii) language classification of\ntweets issued by a set of possibly multi-lingual speakers. We also carry out extensive simulation experiments to further evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed classification scheme over different problem dimensions. The results show that provenance features\nsignificantly improve classification accuracy of social signals, even when no information is known about the sources (besides their\nID). This observation offers a general mechanism for enhancing classification results in social networks.\n"

In this work, we develop MalSpot, multi-resolution and multi-linear (Multi2) network analysis system in order to discover such malicious patterns, so that we can use them later for attack detec- tion, when attacks are concurrent with legitimate traffic. We designed and deployed MalSpot, which employs multi-linear analysis with dif- ferent time resolutions, running on top of MapReduce (Hadoop), and we identify patterns across attackers, attacked institutions and variation of time scales. We collect over a terabyte of proven malicious traces (along with benign ones), from the Taiwanese government security operation center (G-SOC) , during the entire year of 2012. We showcase the effectiveness of MalSpot, by discovering interesting patterns and anomalies on this enormous dataset. We observed static and time-evolving pat- terns, that a vast majority of the known malicious behavior seem to follow."

        "abstract": "Given multiple data sets of relational data that share a number of dimensions, how can we efficiently decompose our data into the latent factors? Factorization of a single matrix or tensor has attracted much attention, as, e.g., in the Netflix challenge, with users rating movies. However, we often have additional, side, information, like, e.g., demographic data about the users, in the Netflix example above. Incorporating the additional information leads to the coupled factorization problem. So far, it has been solved for relatively small datasets.\nWe provide a distributed, scalable method for de- composing matrices, tensors, and coupled data sets through stochastic gradient descent on a variety of ob- jective functions. We offer the following contributions: (1) Versatility: Our algorithm can perform matrix, tensor, and coupled factorization, with flexible objec- tive functions including the Frobenius norm, Frobenius norm with an l1 induced sparsity, and non-negative fac- torization. (2) Scalability: FlexiFaCT scales to un- precedented sizes in both the data and model, with up to billions of parameters. FlexiFaCT runs on standard Hadoop. (3) Convergence proofs showing that Flexi- FaCT converges on the variety of objective functions, even with projections."

We propose to extract concepts that describe groups of objects and their common properties from the integrated data. The discovered concepts provide semantic information as well as an abstract view on the integrated data and thus improve the understanding of complex systems. Our proposed method has the following desirable properties: (a) it is parameter-free and therefore requires no user-defined parameters (b) it is fault-tolerant, allowing for the detection of missing links and (c) it is scalable, being linear on the input size. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method on real, publicly available graphs."

As opposed to traditional clustering\nalgorithms such as k-means and generative mixture models which always result in clusters with\nconvex geometric shape, spectral clustering can solve problems in much more complex scenarios,\nsuch as intertwined spirals, or other arbitrary nonlinear shapes, because it does not make assumptions\non the shapes of clusters. Another disadvantage of the previous algorithms is related to the\ninherent challenges in the ExpectationMaximization (EM) framework, which is often used to learn a mixture model for clustering. This framework is essentially an iterative process of finding local\nminima, and therefore multiple restarts are required to find a good solution."

        "abstract": "Routers are often faced with a variety of users throughout a day. These users make requests, of which the most bandwidth consuming and least delay tolerant are requests for internet content including videos. To save cost of uploading all requested data, routers use content-aware caching schemes. The efficiency of such schemes is dependent on router ability to predict the use of the currently requested content. At the same time, research on social networks indicates that users with social ties have the correlated mobility patterns and the correlated interests in requested content. In this paper, we demonstrate that these correlations between mobility and between interests can be used to improve efficiency of content-based caching network caching by taking into account social ties between users visiting a router. To this end, we built a model for router visits and user demand based on social relations. We then used this model to create a content-aware caching scheme called SOcial Content Caching Scheme (SOCCS). Our results demonstrate\nthat by using information about frequency of visit by members of different social communities combined with topic tags on the\ncontent requested by each community, the performance of routers can be increased remarkably compared to their performance with\nrandom caching. Moreover, such socially based caching is robust to changes in many parameters of our model that affect visits\nby mobile nodes, the tags of content that they request, and how history is incorporated into caching decisions."

Then, we discuss two opposite yet\ncoexisting problems of modularity optimization: in some cases, it tends to favor small communities over large ones while in others, large communities over small ones (so called the resolution limit problem). Next, we overview several community quality metrics proposed to solve the resolution limit problem. Finally, we introduce Modularity Density (Qds) which simultaneously avoids the two problems of modularity. We describe two novel fine-tuned community detection algorithms that iteratively attempt to improve the community quality measurements by splitting and merging the given network community structure. The first of them is based on modularity (Q) and referred to as Fine-tuned Q while the second one is based on Modularity Density (Qds) and denoted as Fine-tuned Qds. Finally, we compare the greedy algorithm of modularity maximization (denoted as Greedy Q), Fine-tuned Q, and Fine-tuned Qds on two real networks, and also on the classical clique network and the LFR benchmark networks, each of which is instantiated by a wide range of parameters. The results indicate that Fine-tuned Qds is the most effective method among the three algorithms discussed. Moreover, we show that Fine-tuned Qds can be applied to the communities detected by other algorithms to significantly improve their results."

We provide the mean-field equation for the underlying dynamics and discuss several properties\nof the equation such as the stationary solutions and two-time-scale separation. For the evolution of the opinion domains we find that the opinion domain boundary propagates at the speed inversely proportional to its curvature.

        "abstract": " Knowledge bases like Wikipedia have been popularly adopted to promote various research topics like semantic relatedness, intent discovery, expert finding and entity disambiguation.  However, when users are investigating deeper into specific domains, e.g., scientific areas, the underlying knowledge structures including both concepts and their semantic links are probably incomplete and out-of-date. Therefore, how to adapt and augment general knowledge bases with respect to a focused domain effectively becomes a critical yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose a mining framework to address this problem via resorting to an auxiliary scientific or technical corpus, e.g., a bibliographic archive. An effective representation called concept network is adopted which consists of augmented concepts as nodes and their relatedness as links. To ensure the quality of this network, a mining model is designed to cluster candidate concepts into link pattern groups such that concepts in the same group have similar qualities. Domain preferences over existing concepts are then automatically quantified and propagated to the new concepts via these link pattern groups. Meanwhile, relatedness between concepts is computed effectively based on the same model. Extensive experiments including quantitative analysis of both concepts and links show the outstanding quality of the constructed concept network."

As such, we consider the problem of discovering topical phrases of mixed lengths. Existing work either performs post processing to the inference results of unigram-based topic models, or utilizes complex n-gram-discovery topic models. These methods generally produce low-quality topical phrases or suffer from poor scalability on large datasets. We propose a different approach that is both computationally efficient and effective. Our solution combines a novel phrase mining framework to segment a document into single and multi-word phrases, and a new topic model that operates on the new document partition. Our approach discovers high quality topical phrases with negligible extra cost to the bag-of-words topic model in research publication titles, abstracts, and news articles."

However, existing network clustering approaches over-simplify the heterogeneity by either treating nodes or links in a homogeneous fashion, resulting in massive loss of information. In addition, these studies are more or less restricted to specific network schemas or applications, losing generality. In this paper, we introduce a flexible model to explain the process of forming heterogeneous links based on shared clustering information of heterogeneous nodes. Specifically, we categorize the link generation process into binary and weighted cases and model them respectively. We show these two cases can be seamlessly integrated into a unified model. We propose to maximize a joint log-likelihood function to infer the model efficiently with Expectation Maximization\n(EM) algorithms. Experiments on real-world networked data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and  exibility of the proposed method in fully capturing the dual heterogeneity of both nodes and links."

Most existing studies assume that all papers adopt the same criterion and follow the same behavioral pattern in deciding relevance and authority of a paper. However, in reality, papers have varying behavioral patterns when looking for possible references, depending on their content, authors and target venues. In this study, we investigate the problem in the context of heterogeneous bibliographic networks and propose a novel cluster-based citation recommendation framework, called ClusCite, which explores the principle that citations tend to be softly clustered into interest groups based on multiple types of relationships in the network. Therefore, we predict each querys citations based on related interest groups, each having its own model for paper authority and relevance. Specifically, we learn group memberships for objects and the significance of relevance features for each interest group, while also propagating relative authority between objects, by solving a joint optimization problem. Experiments on both DBLP and PubMed bibliographic datasets demonstrate the power of the proposed approach, with 17.68% improvement in Recall@50 and 9.57% growth in MRR over the best performing baseline."

In this study, we propose an interesting class of outliers, query-based subnetwork outliers: Given a heterogeneous network, a user raises a query to retrieve a set of task-relevant subnetworks, among which, subnetworks outliers are those that significantly deviate from others (e.g., outliers of author groups among those studying topic modeling). We formalize the problem and propose a general framework. We first utilize frequent pattern mining techniques to retrieve relevant subnetworks according to a given user query, and then introduce the notion of subnetwork similarity that captures the proximity between two subnetworks by their membership distributions.  We propose a ranking algorithm by constructing a factor graph model to calculate the outlierness for each retrieved subnetwork, and show that the proposed algorithm does not need to tune parameters for each query. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines."

        "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the power of modeling real world data as heterogeneous information networks (HINs) consisting of multiple types of entities and relations. Unfortunately, most of such studies (e.g., similarity search) confine discussions on the networks with only a few entity and relationship types, such as DBLP. In the real world, however, the network schema can be rather complex, such as Freebase. In such HINs with rich schema, it is often too much burden to ask users to provide explicit guidance in selecting relations for similarity search. In this paper, we study the problem of relation similarity search in schema-rich HINs. Under our problem setting, users are only asked to provide some simple relation instance examples (e.g., hBarack Obama, John Kerryi and hGeorge W. Bush, Condoleezza Ricei) as a query, and we automatically detect the latent semantic relation (LSR) implied by the query (e.g., president vs. secretary-ofstate). Such LSR will help to find other similar relation instances (e.g., hBill Clinton, Madeleine Albrighti). In order to solve the problem, we first define a new meta-path-based relation similarity measure, RelSim, to measure the similarity between relation instances in schema-rich HINs. Then given a query, we propose an optimization model to effi- ciently learn LSR implied in the query through linear programming, and perform fast relation similarity search using RelSim based on the learned LSR. The experiments on real world datasets derived from Freebase demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."

        "abstract": " Information diffusion has been widely studied in networks, aiming to model the spread of information among objects when they are connected with each other. Most of the current research assumes the underlying network is homogeneous, i.e., objects are of the same type and they are connected by links with the same semantic meanings. However, in the real word, objects are connected via different types of relationships, forming multi-relational heterogeneous information networks.  In this paper, we propose to model information diffusion in such multi-relational networks, by distinguishing the power in passing information around for different types of relationships. We propose two variations of the linear threshold model for multi-relational networks, by considering the aggregation of information at either the model level or the relation level. In addition, we use real diffusion action logs to learn the parameters in these models, which will benefit diffusion prediction in real networks. We apply our diffusion models in two real bibliographic information networks, DBLP network and APS network, and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our models compared with single-relational diffusion models. Moreover, our models can determine the diffusion power of each relation type, which helps us understand the diffusion process better in the multi-relational bibliographic network scenario."

        "abstract": "In many real world applications, the same item may be described by multiple sources. As a consequence, conflicts among these sources are inevitable, which leads to an important task: how to identify which piece of information is trustworthy, i.e., the truth discovery task. Intuitively, if the piece of information is from a reliable source, then it is more trustworthy, and the source that provides trustworthy information is more reliable. Based on this principle, truth discovery approaches have been proposed to infer source reliability degrees and the most trustworthy information (i.e., the truth) simultaneously. However, existing approaches overlook the ubiquitous long-tail phenomenon in the tasks, i.e., most sources only provide a few claims and only a few sources make plenty of claims, which causes the source reliability estimation for small sources to be unreasonable. To tackle this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware truth discovery (CATD) method to automatically detect truths from conflicting data with long-tail phenomenon. The proposed method not only estimates source reliability, but also considers the confidence interval of the estimation, so that it can effectively reflect real source reliability for sources with various levels of participation. Experiments on four real world tasks as well as simulated multi-source long-tail datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art truth discovery approaches by successful discounting the effect of small sources."

        "abstract": "Driven by the advance of positioning technology and the popularity of location-sharing services, semantic-enriched trajectory data have become unprecedentedly available. The sequential patterns hidden in such data, when properly defined and extracted, can greatly benefit tasks like targeted advertising and urban planning. Unfortunately, classic sequential pattern mining algorithms developed for transactional data cannot effectively mine patterns in semantic trajectories, mainly because the places in the continuous space cannot be regarded as independent items. Instead, similar places need to be grouped to collaboratively form frequent sequential patterns.  That said, it remains a challenging task to mine what we call fine-grained sequential patterns, which must satisfy spatial compactness, semantic consistency and temporal continuity simultaneously.  We propose SPLITTER to effectively mine such fine-grained sequential patterns in two steps. In the first step, it retrieves a set of spatially coarse patterns, each attached with a set of trajectory snippets that precisely record the patterns occurrences in the database. In the second step, SPLITTER breaks each coarse pattern into fine-grained ones in a top-down manner, by progressively detecting dense and compact clusters in a higher-dimensional space spanned by the snippets. SPLITTER uses an effective algorithm called weighted snippet shift to detect such clusters, and adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to speed up the top-down pattern splitting process. Our experiments on both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SPLITTER."

Here, we present our results on spread of opinion and the fundamental role played in this spread by two characteristics of the agents, average interconnectivity and level of commitment to the current opinion. Those in turn are dependent on many cultural characteristics of the agent's society, such as trust in others, openness to new views, willingness to discuss certain opinions outside the narrow group of family and close friends, and so on. We also report on our initial investigation how the first factor, average connectivity of social network nodes, varies across cultures based on a study of a real social network. In our Binary Adoption Model (BAM) with committed agents, the spreading of opinions involves two stages. Without sufficient support, the committed minority can advance its cause only by increasing its ranks to the so-called tipping point fraction. After such a fraction is achieved, the opinion spreads rapidly across the society. We discuss how the tipping point fraction is impacted by the two social-based factors mentioned above. "

Representing a collaboration network as a {\\\\em simplicial complex}, we model a missed collaboration as a {\\\\em Minimal Non Face (MNF)}. Focusing on 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional MNFs, equivalent to 3-way and 4-way missed collaborations respectively, we analyze the DBLP publication network and the IMDB movie network. \n\nOur key findings are as follows. A large number of missed collaborations arise, but only a few persist for long. Specifically, the persistence time appears to be exponentially distributed for both 2-MNFs and 3-MNFs. Nodes with higher degree centrality are more likely to be part of 2-MNFs but little correlation was found with 3-MNFs. Considering the network of missed collaborations, the number of components as of year 2013 appears to be power law distributed across MNF types and data sets, but its evolution shows a divergence between DBLP and IMDB. \nOur results can help in developing random generative models of collaboration networks, cue researchers in on potential fruitful collaborations, and predict new collaborations."

However, a huge and growing size of spatial data makes it challenging to process the spatial queries efficiently. In this paper we present a lightweight and scalable spatial index for big data stored in distributed storage systems. We also extend our spatial index for graph models. Our spatial index has several advantages over ex- isting techniques. First, it can be easily applied to existing storage systems or graph models without modifying their internal implementation. Second, it achieves high pruning power by selecting only relevant spatial objects efficiently based on a simple yet effective filter. For example, even though our index does not construct any complicated data structure, the precision (the ratio of true positives to all evaluated spatial objects) of our index is one order of mag- nitude higher than that of an R-tree-based index for those range queries having high selectivity. Third, it supports a customizable and intuitive control of index size (i.e., the precision of indexed geometries). Last but not the least, it supports efficient updates of spatial objects because it does not maintain any costly data structure such as trees. Exper- imental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our spatial indexing technique for different spatial queries."

        "abstract": "This work fulfills sublinear time Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) in massive-scale document collections. The primary contribution is to propose a two-stage unsupervised hashing framework which harmoniously integrates two state-of-the-art hashing algorithms Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Iterative Quantization (ITQ). LSH accounts for neighbor candidate pruning, while ITQ provides an efficient and effective reranking over the neighbor pool captured by LSH. Furthermore, the proposed hashing framework capitalizes on both term and topic similarity among documents, leading to precise document retrieval. The experimental results convincingly show that our hashing based document retrieval approach well approximates the conventional Information Retrieval (IR) method in terms of retrieving semantically similar documents, and meanwhile achieves a speedup of over one order of magnitude in query time.\n"

        "abstract": "The paper presents a new model for crowd-sensing applications, where humans are used as the sensing sources to report information regarding the physical world. In contrast to previous work on the topic, we consider a model where the sources in question are polarized. Such might be the case, for example, in political disputes and in situations involving different communities with largely dissimilar beliefs that color their interpretation and reporting of physical world events. Reconstructing accurate ground truth is more complicated when sources are polarized. The paper describes an algorithm that significantly improves the quality of reconstruction results in the presence of polarized sources. For evaluation, we recorded human observations from Twitter for four months during a recent Egyptian uprising against the former president. We then used our algorithm to reconstruct a version of events and compared it to other versions produced by state of the art algorithms. Our analysis of the data set shows the presence of two clearly defined camps in the social network that tend of propagate largely disjoint sets of claims (which is indicative of polarization), as well as third population whose claims overlap subsets of the former two. Experiments show that, in the presence of polarization, our reconstruction tends to align more closely with ground truth in the physical world than the existing algorithms."

        "abstract": "Information propagation in social media depends not only on the static follower structure but also on the topic-specific user behavior. Hence novel models incorporating dynamic user behavior are needed. To this end, we propose a model for individual social media users, termed a genotype. The genotype is a per-topic summary of a users interest, activity and susceptibility to adopt new information. We demonstrate that user genotypes remain invariant within a topic by adopting them for classification of new information spread in large-scale real networks. Furthermore, we extract topic-specific influence backbone structures based on content adoption and show that their structure differs significantly from the static follower network. We also find, at the population level using a simple contagion model, that hashtags of a known topic propagate at the greatest rate on backbone networks of the same topic. When employed for influence prediction of new content spread, our genotype model and influence backbones enable more than 20% improvement, compared to purely structural features. It is also demonstrated that knowledge of user genotypes and influence backbones allows for the design of effective strategies for latency minimization of topic-specific information spread."

Information is often gathered by individuals of differing expertise in a given topic area. Furthermore, it might be inherently more difficult to determine signal from noise in some topics. Hence, it would be crucial to understand how both the level of expertise and the level of difficulty of a problem impact the ability of a person to correctly classify it. By understanding the distribution of errors, it is possible to create methods to overcome them. To accomplish this, we analyze the results of an experimental study and develop a mathematical model for expertise. To the best of our knowledge, no such model exists. Based on this model, we show how we can develop an agent simulation that mimics the expected performance of a human agent under different conditions."

The first method is based on machine learning and attempts to find a predictive model based on network features. This method is generally geared towards assessing credibility of messages and is able to generate high recall results. The second method is based on a maximum likelihood formulation and attempts to find messages that are corroborated by independent and reliable sources. This method is geared towards finding facts in which humans are treated as binary sensors and is expected to generate high accuracy results but only for those facts that have higher level of corroboration. We show that these two methods can point to similar or quite different predictions depending on the underlying data set. We then illustrate how they can be fused to capture the trade off between favoring true versus credible messages which can either be opinions or not necessarily verifiable."

To this end, we introduce two new measures of central- ity, both based on communities in the network: local and community centrality. Community centrality is a novel concept that we introduce to describe how central ones community is within the whole network. We introduce an algorithm to estimate the distance between communities and use it to find the centrality of communities. Using data from several so- cial networks, we show that central communities incorporate actors who are involved in mainstream activities for that network. We then conduct a detailed study of different so- cial networks and determine how various global measures of prominence relate to structural centrality measures. We show that depending on the underlying measure of prominence, different combinations of local, global and community centrality play an important role in determining the prominence. Local and community centrality measures add new information on top of existing global measures. We show robustness of our results by studying different partitions of the data and different clustering methods. Our deconstruction of centrality al- lows us to study the underlying processes that contribute to prominence in more detail and develop more detailed and accurate models."

        "abstract": "The ability to understand social systems through the aid of computational tools is central to the emerging eld of computational social systems. Such understanding can answer epistemological questions on human behavior in a data-driven manner, and provide prescriptive guidelines for persuading humans to undertake certain actions in real-world social scenarios. The growing number of works in this subeld has the potential to impact multiple walks of human life including health, wellness, productivity, mobility, transportation, education, shopping, and sustenance. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a functional survey of recent advances in sensing, understanding, and shaping human behavior, focusing on real-world behavior of users as measured using passive sensors. Second, we present a case study on how trust, which is an important building block of computational social systems, can be quantified, sensed, and applied to shape human behavior. Our ndings suggest that: 1) trust can be operationalized and predicted via computational methods (passive sensing and network analysis) and 2) trust has a significant impact on social persuasion; in fact, it was found to be significantly more effective than the closeness of ties in determining the amount of behavior change."

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous information networks that consist of multi-type, interconnected objects are becoming ubiquitous and increasingly popular, such as social media networks and bibliographic networks. The task to link named entity mentions detected from the unstructured Web text with their corresponding entities existing in a heterogeneous information network is of practical importance for the problem of information network population and enrichment. This task is challenging due to name ambiguity and limited knowledge \nexisting in the information network. Most existing entity linking methods focus on linking entities with Wikipedia or Wikipedia-derived knowledge bases (e.g., YAGO), and are largely dependent on the special features associated with Wikipedia (e.g., Wikipedia articles or Wikipedia-based relatedness measures). Since heterogeneous information networks do not have such features, these previous methods cannot be applied to our task. In this paper, we propose SHINE, the first probabilistic model to link the named entitieS in Web text with a Heterogeneous Information NEtwork to the best of our knowledge. Our model consists of two components: the entity popularity model that captures the pop-ularity of an entity, and the entity object model that captures the distribution of multi-type objects appearing in the textual context of an entity, which is generated using meta-path constrained random walks over networks. As different meta-paths express diverse semantic meanings and lead to various distributions over objects, different paths have different weights in entity linking. We propose an effective iterative approach to automatically learning the weights for each meta-path based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm without requiring any training data. Experimental results on a real world data set demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model in comparison with the  baselines. \n"

        "abstract": "In many applications, one can obtain descriptions about the same objects or events from a variety of sources. As a result, this will in-\nevitably lead to data or information conflicts. One important problem is to identify the true information (i.e., the truths) among con-\nflicting sources of data. It is intuitive to trust reliable sources more when deriving the truths, but it is usually unknown which one is\nmore reliable a priori. Moreover, each source possesses a variety of properties with different data types. An accurate estimation\nof source reliability has to be made by modeling multiple properties in a unified model. Existing conflict resolution work either\ndoes not conduct source reliability estimation, or models multiple properties separately. In this paper, we propose to resolve conflicts\namong multiple sources of heterogeneous data types. We model the problem using an optimization framework where truths and source\nreliability are defined as two sets of unknown variables. The objective is to minimize the overall weighted deviation between the truths\nand the multi-source observations where each source is weighted by its reliability. Different loss functions can be incorporated into this\nframework to recognize the characteristics of various data types, and efficient computation approaches are developed. Experiments\non real-world weather, stock and flight data as well as simulated multi-source data demonstrate the necessity of jointly modeling dif-\nferent data types in the proposed framework.\n"

Unfortunately, hackers have realized the potential of using apps for spreading malware and spam. The problem is al- ready significant, as we find that at least 13% of apps in our dataset are malicious. So far, the research community has focused on detecting malicious posts and campaigns.\nIn this paper, we ask the question: given a Facebook appli- cation, can we determine if it is malicious? Our key contri- bution is in developing FRAppEFacebooks Rigorous Ap- plication Evaluatorarguably the first tool focused on de- tecting malicious apps on Facebook. To develop FRAppE, we use information gathered by observing the posting be- havior of 111K Facebook apps seen across 2.2 million users on Facebook. First, we identify a set of features that help us distinguish malicious apps from benign ones. For exam- ple, we find that malicious apps often share names with other apps, and they typically request fewer permissions than be- nign apps. Second, leveraging these distinguishing features, we show that FRAppE can detect malicious apps with 99.5% accuracy, with no false positives and a low false negative rate (4.1%). Finally, we explore the ecosystem of malicious Facebook apps and identify mechanisms that these apps use to propagate. Interestingly, we find that many apps collude and support each other; in our dataset, we find 1,584 apps enabling the viral propagation of 3,723 other apps through their posts. Long-term, we see FRAppE as a step towards creating an independent watchdog for app assessment and ranking, so as to warn Facebook users before installing apps."

        "abstract": "Named Entity Disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentions in natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a reference knowledge base (e.g. Wikipedia). Such disambiguation can help add semantics to plain text and distinguish homonymous entities.  Previous research has tackled this problem by making use of two types of features from the reference knowledge base, namely, the context similarity and the topical coherence.  Both features heavily rely on the cross-page hyperlinks within the knowledge base: the topical coherence feature is directly calculated from those hyperlinks, while the context similarity feature implicitly makes use of those hyperlinks to expand entity candidates descriptions and then compares them against the query context. Unfortunately, cross-page hyperlinks are rarely available in many closed domain knowledge bases and it is very expensive to manually add such links. Therefore few algorithms can work well on linkless knowledge bases. In this work, we propose the challenging Named Entity Disambiguation with Linkless Knowledge Bases (LNED) problem and tackle it by leveraging the useful disambiguation evidences scattered across the reference knowledge base. We propose a generative model to automatically mine such evidences out of noisy information. The\nmined evidences can mimic the role of the missing links and help boost the LNED performance. Experimental results show that our proposed method substantially improves the disambiguation accuracy over the baseline approaches."

        "abstract": "This paper considers Quality-of-Information (QoI) aware resource allocation policies for multiuser networks. QoI is a recently introduced composite metric which is impacted by a number of attributes of information communicated from the source(s) to the destination(s), and as such differs from traditional quality- of-service metrics considered to date. The focus of this work is defining the Op- erational Information Content Sum Capacity (OICC-S) of a network, achieved by the set of information attributes supported that maximize sum quality of the network. This quality is defined as a function of the information attributes provided by the source input, as well as the channel induced attributes that impact the QoI delivered to the destination(s). Optimum rate allocation to maximize the output sum Quality of Information and achieve OICC-S of the network for various settings is provided, and demonstrated to differ from the solution that provides maximum throughput, making QoI-awareness necessary in resource allocation. Insights arising from the analysis are provided, along with those from practical scenarios."

        "abstract": "Querying complex graph databases such as knowledge graphs is a challenging task for non-professional users. In this demo, we present SLQ, a user-friendly graph querying system enabling schemaless and structureless graph querying, where a user need not describe queries precisely as required by most databases. SLQ system combines searching and ranking: it leverages a set of transformation functions, including abbreviation, ontology, synonym, etc., that map keywords and linkages from a query to their matches in a data graph, based on an automatically learned ranking model. To help users better understand search results at different levels of granularity, it supports effective result summarization with drill-down and roll-up operations.  Better still, the architecture of SLQ is elastic for new transformation\nfunctions, query logs and user feedback, to iteratively refine the ranking model. SLQ significantly improves the usability of graph querying. This demonstration highlights (1) SLQ can automatically learn an effective ranking model, without assuming manually labeled training examples, (2) it can efficiently return top ranked matches over noisy, large data graphs, (3) it can summarize the query matches to help users easily access, explore and understand query results, and (4) its GUI can interact with users to help them construct queries, explore data graphs and inspect matches in a user-friendly manner."

        "abstract": "Performance monitor software for data centers typically generates a great number of alert sequences. These alert sequences indicate abnormal network events. Given a set of observed alert sequences, it is important to identify the most critical alerts that are potentially the causes of others. While the need for mining critical alerts over large scale alert sequences is evident, most alert analysis techniques stop at\nmodeling and mining the causal relations among the alerts.  This paper studies the critical alert mining problem: Given a set of alert sequences, it is to find a set of critical alerts such that the number of alerts potentially triggered by them is maximized. The problem, although desirable, is intractable; therefore, we resort to approximation and heuristic algorithms. First, we develop a 1  1/e approximation\nalgorithm in quadratic time, and propose pruning techniques to improve its performance. Moreover, we show a faster approximation exists, when the alerts follow certain causal structure. Second, we propose two fast heuristic algorithms based on tree sampling techniques. On real-life data, these algorithms identify a critical alert from up to 270, 000 mined causal relations in 5 seconds; meanwhile, they preserve\nmore than 80% of solution quality, and are up to 5, 000 times faster than their approximation counterparts."

        "abstract": "As a fundamental technique for graph analysis, graph kernels have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems.  Unfortunately, the high computational complexity of existing graph kernels is limiting their further applications to larger-scale graph datasets. In this paper, we propose a fast graph kernel, the descriptor matching (DM) kernel, for graphs with both categorical and numerical attributes. The computation time of the DM kernel is linear with respect to graph size. On graphs with n nodes and m edges, the kernel computation for two graphs can be done in O(n+m) time. Although there are other linear-time graph kernels, most of them are restricted to graphs with only categorical attributes; their efficiency mainly comes from the sparseness of the feature space resulted from the mutually orthogonal categorical attributes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets show promising performance of DM in both accuracy and e_x000E_fficiency."

This question is of great interest to academics, technologists, and financial investors alike. In this work we exploit the singular way in which Facebook wiped out the popularity of MySpace, Hi5, Friendster, and Multiply to guide the design of a new popularity competition model. Our model provides new insights into what Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon called the *marketplace of attention,* which we recast as the attention-activity marketplace. Our model design is further substantiated by user-level activity of 250,000 MySpace users obtained between 2004 and 2009. The resulting model not only accurately fits the observed Daily Active Users (DAU) of Facebook and its competitors but also predicts their fate four years into the future. "

        "abstract": "Preferential attachment (PA) models of network structure are widely used due to their explanatory power and conceptual simplicity. PA models are able to account for the scale-free degree distribution observed in many real-world large networks through the remarkably simple mechanism of sequentially introducing nodes that attach preferentially to nodes with high degree. The ability to efficiently generate instances from PA models is a key asset in understanding both the models themselves and the real networks that they represent. Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to the problem of efficient instance generation. In this paper, we show that the complexity of generating network instances from a PA model depends on the preference function of the model, provide efficient data structures that work under any preference function, and present empirical results from an implementation based on these data structures. We demonstrate that, by indexing growing networks with a simple augmented heap, we can implement a network generator which scales many orders of magnitude beyond existing capabilities (106  108 nodes). We show the utility of an efficient and general PA network generator by investigating the consequences of varying the preference functions of an existing model. We also provide quicknet, a freely-available open-source implementation of the methods described in this work."

We investigate the fundamental characteristics of the underlying collaboration structures that exist in several fields such as sciences and movie production. In this work, we study the basic nature of the underlying collaboration structure using a tool from algebraic topology, namely, the simplicial complex, which is a set system that is closed under subset operation. We propose a generative facet growth model GeneSCs based on preferential attachment (PA) that is based not on an individuals node degree but with his/her facet degree  the underlying intuition is that outsiders are more likely to approach collaborators who are part of multiple collaborations, not people who have many collaborators within a single collaboration. Essentially, collaborations arrive into the system as facets which may be isolated, may partially or completely subsume existing collaborations, or may get subsumed by them. GeneSCs takes as input the facet size distribution (which is not necessarily power law), and two parameters c,  fitted for the relation F_t = cV_t^ for time-evolving pairs (F_t , V_t ) of number of facets and number of vertices in the given data. GeneSCs significantly outperforms the Structural PA model after adapting it to carry out subsump- tions; the latter is unable to yield low KS and TV distances from corresponding distributions in real data for both facet degree and particularly facet size (the latter is not an input for SPA)."

        "abstract": "The ability to control large real-world networks would have numerous applications in natural and technological systems. Network controllability is typically formulated as the ability to drive a network from any initial state to any desired final state in finite time using a minimum number of inputs. Yet, in most circumstances it is neither feasible nor necessary to control the entire network, prompting us to explore target control, the ability to efficiently control a preselected subset of nodes. The standard approach based on structural controllability overestimates the minimum number of driver nodes needed for target control. We develop an alternate *k-walk* theory based on the fact that a single node can control a set of nodes provided the path length from the control node to each target node is unique. We rigorously prove that the k-walk theory is correct for tree networks with a single control input signal. For more general cases, we develop a greedy algorithm to approximate the minimum set of driver nodes sufficient to control the target nodes, allowing us to show that target control has fundamentally different rent features from full control. For example, we find that degree heterogeneous networks can be target controllable with higher e_x000E_efficiency than degree homogeneous networks. Moreover, we show that the structure of many real-world networks, known to be resistant to full control, allow for efficiency target control."

In many real-world recommender systems, however, creating a profile modification based on this feedback involves buying a product, listening to a piece of music or some other costly action. This paper studies the effects of what we call hypo- thetical recommendations: low-cost, exploratory profile manipulations (what-if scenarios) based on informative dynamic feedback from the recommender system. An experiment (N=263) designed to track a users profile manipulation behavior in the presence and absence of recommender feedback is described. Results from this study suggest that (i) feedback during profile manipulations has a biasing effect on user opinion, (ii) iterated profile manipulations after receiving even very few recommendations tends to increase centrality and reduce diversity, (iii) users are more likely to perform profile manipulations while using a visual recommender, and (iv) recommendation accuracy improves linearly with profile manipulations, however, each individual manipulation has more effect on the recommendation accuracy when feedback is not present."

However, when presented with many evidence documents, users do not necessarily read and trust them uniformly. Psychologists and other researchers have shown that users tend to follow and agree with articles and sources that hold viewpoints similar to their own, a phenomenon known as confirmation bias. This suggests that when learning about a controversial topic, human biases and viewpoints about the topic may affect what is considered trustworthy or credible. It is an interesting challenge to build systems that can help users overcome this bias and help them decide the truthfulness of claims.\n\nIn this paper, we study various factors that enable humans to acquire additional information about controversial claims in an unbiased fashion. Specifically, we designed a user study to understand how presenting evidence with contrasting viewpoints and source expertise ratings affect how users learn from the evidence documents. We find that users do not seek contrasting viewpoints by themselves, but explicitly presenting contrasting evidence helps them get a well-rounded understanding of the topic. Furthermore, explicit knowledge of the credibility of the sources and the context in which the source provides the evidence document not only affects what users read, but also whether they perceive the document to be credible."

        "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) continues to grow in popularity in a range of research and commercial applications. However, installing, maintaining, and running NLP tools can be time consuming, and many commercial and research end users have only intermittent need for large processing capacity. This paper describes IllinoisCloudNLP, an on-demand framework built around NLP Curator and Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This framework provides a simple interface to end users via which they can deploy one or more NLP Curator instances on EC2, upload plain text documents, specify a set of Text Analytics tools (NLP annotations) to apply, and process and store or download the processed data. It also allows end users to use a model trained on their own data: IllinoisCloudNLP takes care of training, hosting, and applying it to new data just as it does with existing models within NLP Curator. As a representative use case, we describe our use of IllinoisCloudNLP to process 3:05 million documents used in the 2012 and 2013 Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population tasks at a relatively deep level of processing, in approximately 20 hours, at an approximate cost of US$500; this is about 20 times faster than doing so on a single server and requires no human supervision and no NLP or Machine Learning expertise."

        "abstract": "Availability of big data from the Social Web provides a unique opportunity for synergy between the computational and social sciences.   On one hand, psychologists and social scientists have developed and established models of human competence, credibility, trust and skill over many years.  Currently, much research is being conducted by computer scientists to evaluate these human-behavioral aspects using real-world data from Twitter and other sources.  However, many of these algorithms are formulated in an ad-hoc way, without much reference to established theory from the existing literature.    This paper presents a framework for mapping existing models of human competence and skill onto a real world streaming data from a social network.   An example mapping is described using the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition, and an analysis and discussion of resulting feature distributions is presented on four topic-specific data collections from Twitter, including one on the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.   The mapping is evaluated using human assessments of competence through a crowd sourced study of 150 participants. "

The formation and decay of trust in recommendations is a dynamic process influenced by context, human preferences, accuracy of recommendations, and the interactions of these factors. This paper describes two psychological experiments (N=400) that evaluate the evolution of trust in recommendations over time, under personalized and non-personalized recommendations by matching or not matching a participants profile. Main findings include: Humans trust inaccurate recommendations more than they should; when recommendations are personalized, they lose trust in inaccurate recommendations faster than when recommendations are not personalized; and participants learn to select the options that provide best outcomes increasingly over time when they use personalized recommendations, while they are unable to learn if the recommendations are not personalized. We make connections to the possible implications that these psychological findings to the design of recommender systems."

        "abstract": "Verb errors are some of the most common mistakes made by non-native writers of English but some of the least studied. The reason is that dealing with verb errors requires a new paradigm; essentially all research done on correcting grammatical errors assumes a closed set of triggers  e.g., correcting the use of prepositions or articles  but identifying mistakes in verbs necessitates identifying potentially ambiguous triggers first, and then determining the type of mistake made and correcting it. Moreover, once the verb is identified, modeling verb errors is challenging because verbs fulfill many grammatical functions, resulting in a variety of mistakes. Consequently, the little earlier work done on verb errors assumed that the error type is known in advance.\n\nWe propose a linguistically-motivated approach to verb error correction that makes use of the notion of verb finiteness to identify triggers and types of mistakes, before using a statistical machine learning approach to correct these mistakes. We show that the linguistically-informed model significantly improves the accuracy of the verb correction approach."

These networks support applications used by the military and first responders, especially in emergency situations. Securing a DTN is not a trivial undertaking due to node mobility and the ADHOC method in which nodes communicate. Here, we propose a distributed trust management scheme to secure this class of networks with many of the underlying principles applicable to the larger class of Mobile ADHOC Networks (MANET). The scheme employs erasure coding not only to increase delivery rate in a DTN but also to infer the trustworthiness of the nodes along all paths that deliver a message segments to the destination. The proposed approach enables us to decide when the destination node should stop waiting for additional segments and instead request message retransmission. Moreover, even after the message is recreated successfully, additional segments received enable the destination to collect precious trust information about the nodes involved in delivery of these segments. We show how distributing this trust information identifies compromised nodes."

VCP analysis offers a new tool for researchers and domain experts to understand the underlying growth mechanisms in their networks and to analyze link formation mechanisms in the appropriate sociological, biological, physical, or other context. The same resolution that gives the VCP method its analytical power also enables it to perform well when used to accomplish link prediction. We first develop the theory, mathematics, and algorithms underlying VCPs. We provide timing results to demonstrate that the algorithms scale well even for large networks. Then we demonstrate VCP methods performing link prediction competitively with unsupervised and supervised methods across different network families. Unlike many analytical tools, VCPs inherently generalize to multirelational data, which provides them with unique power in complex modeling tasks. To demonstrate this, we apply the VCP method to longitudinal networks by encoding temporally resolved information into different relations. In this way, the transitions between VCP elements represent temporal evolutionary patterns in the longitudinal network data. Results show that VCPs can use this additional data, typically challenging to employ, to improve predictive model accuracies. We conclude with our perspectives on the VCP method and its future in network science, particularly link prediction."

In particular, we study the problem in which network agents exchange and revise belief functions (which generalize probability mass functions) and are more geared towards handling the uncertainty pervasive in soft/hard fusion environments. We focus on belief revision in which agents utilize a generalized fusion rule that is capable of generating a rational consensus. It includes the widely used weighted average consensus as a special case. By establishing this fusion scheme as a pool of paracontracting operators, we derive general convergence criteria that are relevant for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions for consensus for various social networks by simulating several network topologies and communication patterns that are characteristic of such networks."

        "abstract": "The proliferation of smart phones with sensing capabilities motivates exploring the applicability limits of (phone based) mobile sensing. While a phone can directly measure variables such as location, acceleration, and orientation, most of the interesting quantities one may want to measure have higher-level semantics that a phone does not directly recognize. For example, one might want to map parking lots that are free after hours, or restaurants that are popular after midnight. How can we measure such higher-level logical quantities using sensors on phones? Techniques that address this question fall in the broad area of surrogate sensing, defined as inferring high-level logical quantities by measuring weaker surrogates. The surrogates in question are variables that can be sensed using a phone, but that are only weakly related to the original high-level logical quantities one is really after. The key challenge is to exploit\nappropriate aggregation techniques that leverage the availability of large numbers of phones to overcome the poor quality of\nindividual surrogates. Recently, significant advances were made on understanding the quality limits of surrogate sensing. This\narticle overviews the main ideas and insights underlying these advances."

The prevalence of SM use globally and its growing significance to the evolution of events has attracted the attention of the Army and other agencies charged with protecting national security interests. The information exchanged in SM sites and the networks of people who interact with these online communities can provide value to Army intelligence efforts. SM could facilitate the Military Decision Making Process by providing ongoing assessment of military actions from a local citizen perspective. Despite potential value, there are significant technological barriers to leveraging SM. SM collection and analysis are difficult in the dynamic SM environment and deception is a real concern. This paper introduces a credibility analysis approach and prototype fact-finding technology called the Apollo Fact-finder that mitigates the problem of inaccurate or falsified SM data. Apollo groups data into sets (or claims), corroborating specific observations, then iteratively assesses both claim and source credibility resulting in a ranking of claims by likelihood of occurrence. These credibility analysis approaches are discussed in the context of a conflict event, the Syrian civil war, and applied to tweets collected in the aftermath of the Syrian chemical weapons crisis. "

        "abstract": "This paper complements the large body of social sensing literature by developing means for augmenting sensing data with inference results that fill-in missing pieces. Unlike trend-extrapolation methods, we focus on prediction in disaster scenarios where disruptive trend changes occur. A set of prediction heuristics (and a standard trend extrapolation algorithm) are compared that use either predominantly-spatial or predominantly-temporal correlations for data extrapolation purposes. The evaluation shows that none of them do well consistently. This is because monitored system state, in the aftermath of disasters, alternates between periods of relative calm and periods of disruptive change (e.g., aftershocks). A good prediction algorithm, therefore, needs to intelligently combine time-based data extrapolation during periods of calm, and spatial data extrapolation during periods of change. The paper develops such an algorithm. The algorithm is tested using data collected during the New York City crisis in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in November 2012. Results show that consistently good predictions are achieved. The work is unique in addressing the bi-modal nature of damage propagation in complex systems subjected to stress, and offers a simple solution to the problem."

        "abstract": "This paper describes the exploitation of hierarchical data names to achieve information-utility maximizing data collection in social sensing applications. We describe a novel transport abstraction, called the information funnel. It encapsulates a data collection protocol for social sensing that maximizes a measure of delivered information utility, that is the minimized data redundancy, by diversifying the data objects to be collected. The abstraction leverages named-data networking, a communication paradigm where data objects are named instead of hosts. We argue that this paradigm is especially suited for utility-maximizing transport in resource constrained environments, because hierarchical data names give rise to a notion of distance between named objects that is a function of only the topology of the name tree. This distance, in turn, can expose similarities between named objects that can be leveraged for minimizing redundancy among objects transmitted over bottlenecks, thereby maximizing their aggregate utility. With a proper hierarchical name space design, our protocol prioritizes transmission of data objects over bottlenecks to maximize information utility, with very weak assumptions on the utility function. This prioritization is achieved merely by comparing data name prefixes, without knowing application-level name semantics, which makes it generalizable across a wide range of applications. Evaluation results show that the information funnel improves the utility of the collected data objects compared to other lossy protocols.\n"

Current methods for network-wide broadcasting are ill-suited for Multi-Channel Multi-Radio (MC-MR) networks because they do not exploit the presence of natural frequency groups for reducing the number of transmissions.\nWe present Complex Activation Broadcasting (CAB)  a de- centralized algorithm for broadcasting in real-world MC-MR networks that captures naturally occurring groups and builds a tree that exploits them. Our approach is based on representing a network as a simplicial complex, which unlike a graph, allows higher-order aggregations necessary for natively capturing groups. Using a special kind of simplicial complex called a neighborhood complex we present an algorithm for computing a broadcast tree. We have implemented our algorithm within the code base of a real-world military MANET, namely the DARPA WNaN network [1]. We compare the performance of our algorithm with the existing baseline. Results show that our algorithm uses 80 % less transmissions and 50% less receptions."

Such temporal community structure of MANETs has been shown to be extremely useful in improving the performance of routing and content-based routing in MANETs [1][4]. How- ever, detecting temporal communities in a completely distributed and real time manner is a hard problem, and it is often performed offline with knowledge of the full network topology over time.\nWe propose, CLAN, a distributed and real-time protocol for detecting temporal communities in MANETs. CLAN is an adaptation of the Label Propagation algorithm to distributed and time-varying graphs that MANETs are. A key component is local rules for community redisocvery as the the network evolves. CLAN also uses a weighted version of the network topology where the weights are defined using a novel notion of social entropy to promote stability of communities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that CLAN is quick to converge, incurs minimal overhead and is as effective as centralized approaches to temporal community detection. We also demonstrate the utility of temporal community structure by designing a hierarchical routing protocol that achieves the delivery ratio of the OLSR routing protocol at a fraction of the overhead.\n"

        "abstract": "This paper explores the design of in-network caching policies for non-independent spot reporting content. The problem is motivated by autonomous sensor devices, such as soldier mounted cameras, that collect and store correlated data from the physical world. Physical states exhibit correlations in space and in time that need to be considered in caching decisions. Prior work in sensor networks that exploits correlations between content items focused more on efficient data collection, not caching, whereas work on caching mostly assumed that cached objects are independent. In contrast, when cached objects overlap in information content, such as pictures of a scene taken from different vantage points, the utility from storing similar items is sub-additive, motivating a fresh look at content- aware replacement policies. We describe a new caching policy, called diversity caching, that factors in both popularity and non- independence among objects into cache replacement algorithms. In a military environment, such a caching scheme supports a multi-modal information access model. Edge devices collect more data than the terrestrial network can handle, push high priority content directly through the network, and then use delay tolerant store and forward mechanisms to transmit the remaining content upon return to base. In information fusion systems, this provides immediate access to a wide variety of user queried content while remaining within the constraints of the terrestrial network and not relying on more expensive satellite networks. This paper evaluates diversity caching in the context of a disaster response application, where survivors and first responders survey damage and up-load observations into caches that are queried by others. Evaluation shows that diversity caching substantially improves a notion of coverage over previous replacement policies, such as LRU and Intentional Caching."

        "abstract": "User demographic information offers a great potential for business\nintelligence in the world of networks, such as viral marketing, personalized\nservices and targeting promotion. However, we have little\nunderstanding of human interactions on demographics and how\nhuman social strategies evolve across lifespan. The recent availability\nof massive mobile data with user demographics provides us\nunprecedented opportunities to understand human interactions and\ntheir social strategies.\nIn this paper, we first investigate the interplay of human interactions\nand their demographics in a large mobile social network, with\nmore than 7 million users and 1 billion communication records.\nSeveral unique social strategies are revealed from human interactions.\nYoung people broaden and enlarge their social circles\nand tend to put more social investment to maintain social relationships\nsmall, but close and balanced as aging. Also, the instability\nof opposite-gender triadic relationships and persistence of samegender\ntriads across human lifespan are discovered for the first\ntime, which reveal more complex dynamics on human social strategies\nthan the static view.\nWe further study to what extent user demographics are revealed\nby their social connections. We formalize a double dependentvariable\nprediction probleminferring user gender and age simultaneously.\nWe propose Double Dependent-Variable Factor Graph\n(DFG) to solve this problem by employing not only the effects of\nfeatures on gender/age, but also the interrelation between gender\nand age. To handle large-scale networks, we further introduce a\ndistributed learning algorithm that can speed up the DFG model\nalmost linearly. Our experiments on both call and short-message\nnetworks demonstrate that our model outperforms a series of classical\nbaseline algorithms."

However, due to the complexity and diversity of linguistic representations, it is challenging to build a framework that accurately extracts such sentiment. We propose a semi-supervised framework for generating a domain-specific sentiment lexicon and inferring sentiments at the segment level. Our framework can greatly reduce the human effort for building a domain- specific sentiment lexicon with high quality. Specifically, in our evaluation, working with just 20 manually labeled reviews, it generates a domain-specific sentiment lexicon that yields weighted average F- Measure gains of 3%. Our sentiment classification model achieves approximately 1% greater accuracy than a state-of-the-art approach based on elementary discourse units."

We develop a general approach representing the relationships among these concepts via a Bayesian network model. Our approach incorporates insights from the literature and provides a computational methodology for identifying improved Bayesian models. Based on observations from an empirical study, we motivate a refined Bayesian model involving the above-mentioned concepts that goes beyond the relationships known in the literature. Our findings include (1) the violation of a commitment affects trust more than its satisfaction; (2) goal satisfaction affects mood and emotion more than commitment satisfaction, but the out- come of a commitment affects trust more than the outcome of a goal; and (3) an agents prior mood and trust affect whether it satisfies its commitments."

We propose an approach relating trust to the domain-independent notion of commitments. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate our approach, in which subjects read emails extracted from the Enron dataset (augmented with some synthetic emails for completeness), and estimate trust between each pair of communicating participants. We propose a probabilistic model for trust based on commitment outcomes and show how to train its parameters for each subject based on the subjects trust assessments. The results are promising, though imperfect. Our main contribution is to launch a re- search program into computing trust based on a semantically well-founded account of agent interactions."

Recent advances have provided us an analytical framework of core percolation in uncorrelated random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. Here we apply the tools in analysis of network controllability. We confirm analytically that the emergence of the bifurcation in control coincides with the formation of the core and the structure of the core determines the control mode of the network. We also derive the analytical expression related to the controllability robustness by extending the deduction in core percolation. These findings help us better understand the interesting interplay between the structural and dynamical properties of complex networks."

Although several overlapping extensions of modularity were proposed to measure the quality of overlapping community structure, there is lack of systematic comparison of different extensions. To fill this gap, we overview overlapping extensions of modularity to select the best. In addition, we extend the Modularity Density metric to enable its usage for overlapping communities. The experimental results on four real networks using overlapping extensions of modularity, overlapping modularity density, and six other community quality metrics show that the best results are obtained when the product of the belonging coefficients of two nodes is used as the belonging function. Moreover, our experiments indicate that overlapping modularity density is a better measure of the quality of overlapping community structure than other metrics considered."

These parameters define varying listener-speaker interactions on the individual level with one parameter controlling the speaker and the other controlling the listener of each interaction. The major finding presented here is that the generalized Naming Game preserves the existence of critical thresholds for the size of committed minorities. Above such threshold, a committed minority causes a fast (in time logarithmic in size of the network) convergence to consensus even when there are other parameters influencing the system. Below such threshold, reaching consensus requires time exponential in the size of the network. Moreover, the two introduced parameters cause bifurcations in the stabilities of the systems fixed points and may lead to changes in the systems consensus."

Skeleton is constructed based on best friendship\nand skeleton construction is simple and efficient (e.g., less computational\ncomplexity than community detection).

In this paper, we consider the problem of timely delivery of these reports: each report has an associated deadline and the goal of the system is to retrieve as many reports as possible (or retrieve the most valuable reports), while satisfying each reports deadline. Reporters can use their cellular interface to upload their reports, but can also ask neighbors (using their faster WiFi interface) to help upload parts of their reports. Under an assumption that WiFi transmission delays are negligible, we first show that there exists a polynomial time optimal solution using an earliest- deadline-first (EDF) strategy for achieving the goals described above. In practice, WiFi delays are not negligible: in this case, it turns out that the scheduling problem is strongly NP-hard. We formulate two heuristic algorithms, and show, through simulations as well as experiments on an Android- based implementation, that these heuristics perform 2-4 better than without peer-assistance, and within 60% of an upper-bound on the optimal."

The trust can change as a function of\n    network activity, leading to dynamic scenarios. The framework is\n    implemented as an open source simulation package and is fully\n    extensible. With the help of an information sharing scenario, we\n    conduct a sensitivity analysis and demonstrate the impact of all\n    components of the framework to various network outcomes. In\n    particular, we illustrate that the model provides the ability to\n    study many different trade-offs in team performance and\n    interaction between different parameters.  "

We analyze both analytical upper bounds of dominating sets and numerical realizations for applications. We propose two novel probabilistic dominating set selection strategies that are applicable to heterogeneous networks. One of them obtains the smallest probabilistic dominating set and also outperforms the deterministic degree-ranked method. We show that a degree dependent probabilistic selection method becomes optimal in its deterministic limit. In addition, we also find the precise limit where selecting high-degree nodes exclusively becomes inefficient for network domination. We validate our results on several real-world networks, and provide highly accurate analytical estimates for our methods."

In this paper, we present a batch-mode active learning method based on logistic regression. Our key motivation is an out-of-sample bound on the estimation error of class distribution in logistic regression conditioned on any fixed training sample. It is different from a typical PAC-style passive learning error bound, that relies on the i.i.d. assumption of example-label pairs. In addition, it does not contain the class labels of the training sample. Therefore, it can be immediately used to design an active learning algorithm by minimizing this bound iteratively. We also discuss the connections between the proposed method and some existing active learning approaches. Experiments on benchmark UCI datasets and text datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art active learning methods significantly."

Additionally, this document describes preliminary experiment designs, using the mixed fidelity paradigm, for studying these network science questions.\n\nMixed fidelity experimentation enables several key advances in network science experimentation. The main motivation for mixed fidelity experimentation is that it is not always feasible or necessary to run experiments on large-scale, high fidelity networks, yet it is often desirable to run experiments on networks where at least some of the nodes are interacting under conditions of realistic complexity.\n\nThe main benefits of the mixed fidelity approach to experimentation are:\n-Improved realism: By embedding high fidelity nodes within the context of a larger network which is modeled at a lower level of detail, experimenters can avoid some of the artifacts resulting from edge effects on very small networks.\n-Increased scale: By combining large-scale, lower fidelity nodes with a small number of high fidelity focus nodes, this approach enables the overall experiment to encompass a much larger network.\n-Better access to cross network genre phenomena: Some inter network genre effects cannot be explored unless particular aspects of each network are modeled at high fidelity. A mixed fidelity experimentation framework offers a way to bring together these disparate network genre models into the same experiment."

The proliferation of online media such as Twitter, Facebook, Orkut and MMORPGs\\\\footnote{Massively Multi-player Online Role Playing Games} have created social networking data at an unprecedented scale. Sony's Everquest 2 is one such example. We used game multi-relational networks to reveal the dynamics of evolution in a multi-relational setting by macroscopic study of the game network. Macroscopic analysis involves fragmenting the network into smaller portions for studying the dynamics within these sub-networks, referred to as `communities'. From an evolutionary perspective of multi-relational network analysis, we have made the following contributions. Specifically, we formulated and analyzed various metrics to capture evolutionary properties of networks. We find that co-evolution rates in trust based `communities' are approximately 60% higher than the trade based `communities'. We also find that the trust and trade connections within the `communities' reduce as their size increases. Finally, we study the interrelation between the dynamics of trade and trust within `communities' and find interesting results about the precursor relationship between the trade and the trust dynamics within the `communities'."

Automatic extraction of the most informative and important multimedia summary (e.g. a ranked list of inter-connected texts and images) from massive amounts of cross-media and cross-genre data can significantly save users time and effort that is consumed in browsing. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod to address this new task based on automatically constructed Multi-media Information Networks (MiNets) by incorporating cross-genre knowledge and inferring implicit similarity across texts and images. The facts from MiNets are exploited in a novel random walk-based algorithm to iteratively propagate ranking scores across multiple data modalities. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our MiNets-based approach and the power of cross-media cross-genre inference."

Our framework draws upon theory and research on information processing, social categorization, coordination, and homophily to posit the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity on innovation.  Our longitudinal model is based on a unique dataset of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of Oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a four-year period.  We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks.  We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation.

        "abstract": "Innovative tasks are increasingly being completed in more complex networks of teams, or multi-team systems (MTSs).  These MTSs allow for the distribution of domain-specific tasks to different experts located in different teams while enabling a flow of ideas between teams.  However, they require members to rely on other teams whom they may never meet face-to-face.  Therefore, forces that provide structure within the team are necessary to ensure that ideas are shared and tasks are completed.  Functional leadership theory suggests the need for divergent (creativity-enhancing) leadership and convergent (decision-making) leadership to enhance innovation.  Since leadership is a relational concept, we use p*/ERGMs to analyze the influence of divergent & convergent leadership reliance networks on the innovativeness of multi-team systems.  We use data from a multi-institutional, cross-functional study of 31 MTSs, with 4 component teams each composed of 9 - 12 members to perform this study."

        "abstract": "Complex network phenomena  such as information cascades in online social networks  are hard to fully observe, model, and forecast. In forecasting, a recent trend has been to forgo the use of parsimonious models in favor of models with in- creasingly large degrees of freedom that are trained to learn the behavior of a process from historical data. Extrapolat- ing this trend into the future, eventually we would like to renounce models all together. But is it possible to forecast the evolution of a complex stochastic process directly from the data without a model? In this work we show that the answer is yes. We present SED, an algorithm that forecasts process statistics based on relationships of statistical equivalence using two general axioms and historical data. To the best of our knowledge, SED is the first method that can perform axiomatic, model-free forecasts of complex stochastic processes. Our simulations using simple and complex evolving processes and tests performed on a large real-world dataset show promising results."

Modeling and mining popularity dynamics of social activity has important im- plications for researchers, content creators and providers. We here investigate the effect of revisits (successive visits from a single user) on content popularity. Using four datasets of social activity, with up to tens of millions media objects (e.g., YouTube videos, Twitter hashtags or LastFM artists), we show the effect of revisits in the popularity evolution of such objects. Secondly, we propose the PHOENIX-R model which captures the popularity dynamics of individual objects. PHOENIX-R has the desired properties of being: (1) parsimonious, being based on the minimum description length principle, and achieving lower root mean squared error than state-of-the-art baselines; (2) applicable, the model is effective for predicting future popularity values of objects."

        "abstract": "Today's cyber-physical systems (CPS) increasingly operate in social spaces. Examples include transportation systems, disaster response systems, and the smart grid, where humans are the drivers, survivors, or users. Much information about the evolving system can be collected from humans in the loop; a practice that is often called crowd-sensing. Crowd-sensing has not traditionally been considered a CPS topic, largely due to the difficulty in rigorously assessing its reliability. This paper aims to change that status quo by developing a mathematical approach for quantitatively assessing the probability of correctness of collected observations (about an evolving physical system), when the observations are reported by sources whose reliability is unknown. Thereby, we solve the main data reliability challenge in crowd-sensing systems, hence enabling their exploitation as state estimators in CPS feedback loops. We first consider applications where state is described by a number of binary variables, then extend the approach trivially to multivalued variables. The approach also extends prior work that addressed the problem in the special case of systems whose state does not change over time. Evaluation results, using both simulation and a real-life case-study, demonstrate the accuracy of the approach."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a generalized decision aggregation (GDA) framework that integrates information from distributed sensor nodes for decision making in a resource efcient manner. Traditional approaches that target similar problems only take as input the discrete label information from individual sensors that observe the same events. Different from them, our proposed GDA framework is able to take advantage of the condence information of each sensor about its decision, and thus achieves higher decision accuracy. Targeting generalized problem domains, our framework can naturally handle the scenarios where different sensor nodes observe different sets of events whose numbers of possible classes may also be different. GDA also makes no assumption about the availability level of ground truth label information, while being able to take advantage of any if present. For these reasons, our approach can be applied to a much broader spectrum of sensing scenarios. The advantages of our proposed framework are demonstrated through both theoretic analysis and extensive experiments."

Such problems have applications in networking and operations research, where decisions can be constrained to discrete sets and time averages can represent bit rates, power expenditures, and so on. These problems can be solved by Lyapunov optimization. This paper shows that a simple drift- based algorithm, related to a classic dual subgradient algorithm, converges to an -optimal solution within O(1/^2) time steps. However, when the problem has a unique vector of Lagrange multipliers, the algorithm is shown to have a transient phase and a steady state phase. By restarting the time averages after the transient phase, the total convergence time is improved to O(1/^1.5) under a locally-smooth assumption, and to O(1/) under a locally-polyhedron assumption."

We propose Guven, an approach that relates trust to the domain-independent notion of commitments.  We conducted empirical studies of two decision contexts.  First,subjects read emails extracted from the Enron dataset (and augmented with some synthetic emails for completeness), and estimated trust between each pair of communicating participants.  Second, the subjects played the Colored Trails game, estimating trust in their opponents.  Guven incorporates a probabilistic model for trust based on commitment outcomes and show how to train its parameters for each subject based on the subject's assessments.  The results are promising, though imperfect.  Our main contribution is to launch a research program into computing trust based on a semantically well-founded account of interpersonal interactions."

Existing approaches to identify hierarchy are limited to data from where graphs can be extracted easily.  We contribute a novel approach that takes broadcast messages as inputs, extracts and analyses response patterns---as well as communication, semantic and social features---and outputs an organizational hierarchy.  Our output estimates of hierarchy were assessed versus ground truth in a data sets consisting of broadcast chat communications from a large-scale Army exercise.

The precursor is a nonlinear\nrelation between the fraction of individuals holding a certain extreme\nview and the fraction of individuals that includes also moderates,\ne.g., those who are ``very conservative'' in politics versus\n``moderate to very conservative''. The onset of nonlinearity forecasts\nthe transition from moderate to extreme opinion before it actually\noccurs.  It is an early-warning signal of an abrupt\nbootstrap-percolation transition where extreme opinions cascade\nthrough society due to people's ``stubbornness'', as suggested by\nmodeling. By means of a phase diagram given in terms of critical\nfractions of extremists and number of people's ties, we classify\nsocieties from moderate to extreme. The nonlinear analysis can be\nextended to stock market investors sentiment or competition of\ninnovations of any kind, allowing to forecast sudden market events or\nadoption of new products."

While small, cost-efficient dominating sets play a significant role in controllability and observability of these networks, a fixed and intact network structure is always implicitly assumed. We find that cost-efficiency of dominating sets optimized for small size alone comes at a price of being vulnerable to damage; domination in the remaining network can be severely disrupted, even if a small fraction of dominator nodes are lost. We develop two new methods for finding flexible dominating sets, allowing either adjustable overall resilience, or dominating set size, while maximizing the dominated fraction of the remaining network after the attack. We analyze the efficiency of each method on synthetic scale-free networks, as well as real complex networks."

This document will refer primarily to EMANE as the comms layer under the Shim, but other comms layers (NS3, WNaN, Android) could also be used.\n\nThe design is intended to follow REST API architecture of using a client/server model, being stateless, cacheable, and layered. The goal of the design is to be portable, modular, and easy to use. Multiple applications can register with the Shim using JSON as the standard interface language. The Shim organizes connected modules into a stack, similar to the OSI stack, such that when a module at the top of the stack sends a message, each module below it is handed the message in turn before it is sent out to EMANE. The reverse is executed at the receive end.\n\nThe design will also allow for a control interface to pass meta data that external modules do not want to send across EMANE, such as how many packets the receiver should expect or the time a packet was sent, to calculate delays.\n"

We consider two sets of networks; one contains several networks with real-life communities, the other networks generated with the Watts-Strogatz and Barabsi-Albert models. For each set, we run NG on all the possible pairs of networks and observe whether a consensus is reached to determine network features that correlate highly with such outcome. The main conclusion is that the quality of network community structure informs network's ability to resist or exert influence from/on others. Moreover, the outcomes depend on whether Speaker-First of Listener-First NG is run and on whether a speaker or listener is biased towards high or low degree nodes. The results reveal strategies that may be used to enable and accelerate convergence to consensus in social networks."

        "abstract": "Many networks display community structure which identifies groups of nodes within which connections are denser than between them. Detecting and characterizing such community structure, which is known as community detection, is one of the fundamental issues in the study of network systems. It has received a considerable attention in the last years. Numerous techniques have been developed for both efficient and effective community detection. Among them, the most efficient algorithm is the label propagation algorithm whose computational complexity is O(|E|). Although it is linear in the number of edges, the running time is still too long for very large networks, creating the need for parallel community detection. Also, computing community quality metrics for community structure is computationally expensive both with and without ground truth. However, to date we are not aware of any effort to introduce parallelism for this problem. In this paper, we provide a parallel toolkit to calculate the values of such metrics. We evaluate the parallel algorithms on both distributed memory machine and shared memory machine. The experimental results show that they yield a significant performance gain over sequential execution in terms of total running time, speedup, and efficiency."

To mine periodicity in an event, we have to face real-world challenges of inherently complicated periodic behaviors and imperfect data collection problem. Specifically, the hidden temporal periodic behaviors could be oscillating and noisy, and the observations of the event could be incomplete. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic measure for periodicity and design a practical algorithm, ePeriodicity, to detect periods. Our method has thoroughly considered the uncertainties and noises in periodic behaviors and is provably robust to incomplete observations. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod"

        "abstract": "In many of todays online applications that facilitate data exploration, results from information filters such as recommender systems are displayed alongside traditional search tools. However, the effect of prediction algorithms on users who are performing open-ended data exploration tasks through a search interface is not well understood. This pa- per describes a study of three interface variations of a tool for analyzing commuter traffic anomalies in the San Francisco Bay Area. The system supports novel interaction between a prediction algorithm and a human analyst, and is designed to explore the boundaries, limitations and synergies of both. The degree of explanation of underlying data and algorithmic process was varied experimentally across each interface. The experiment (N=197) was performed to assess the impact of algorithm transparency/explanation on data analysis tasks in terms of search success, general insight into the underlying data set and user experience. Results show that 1) presence of recommendations in the user interface produced a significant improvement in recall of anomalies, 2) participants were able to detect anomalies in the data that were missed by the algorithm, 3) participants who used the prediction algorithm performed significantly better when estimating quantities in the data, and 4) participants in the most explanatory condi- tion were the least biased by the algorithms predictions when estimating quantities."

        "abstract": "What is happening around the world? When and where? Mining the geo-tagged Twitter stream makes it possible to answer the above questions in real-time. Although a single tweet can be short and noisy, proper aggregations of tweets can provide meaningful results. In this paper, we focus on hierarchical spatio-temporal hashtag clustering techniques. Our system has the following features: (1) Exploring events (hashtag clusters) with different space granularity. Users can zoom in and out on maps to find out what is happening in a particular area;  (2) exploring events with different time granularity. Users can choose to see what is happening today or in the past week;  (3) efficient single-pass algorithm for event identification, which provides human-readable hashtag clusters; and (4) efficient event ranking which aims to find burst events and localized events given a particular region and time frame.  To support aggregation with different space and time granularity, we propose a data structure called STREAMCUBE, which is an extension of the data cube structure from the database community with spatial and temporal hierarchy.  To achieve high scalability, we propose a divide-and-conquer method to construct the STREAMCUBE.  To support flexible event ranking with different weights, we proposed a top-k based index. Different efficient methods are used to speed up event similarity computations. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on a real twitter data.  Experimental results show that our framework can provide meaningful results with high scalability."

Here we study the effect of\nstickiness of opinions in a two-opinion model, where individuals change their opinion only after a certain number of consecutive\nencounters with the alternative opinion. Assuming that one opinion has a fixed stickiness, we investigate how the critical size of the competing opinion required to tip over the entire population varies as a function of the competing opinion's stickiness. We analyze this scenario for the case of a complete-graph topology through simulations, and through a semi-analytical approach which yields an upper bound for the critical minority size. We present analogous simulation results for the case of the Erdos-Renyi random network. Finally, we investigate the coarsening properties of sticky opinion spreading on two-dimensional lattices, and show that the presence of stickiness gives rise to an effective surface tension that causes the coarsening behavior to become curvature-driven."

Unfortunately, this can hurt performance in many cases; via an extensive measurement study, we show that using middleboxes to facilitate compression results in up to 32% degradation in page load times when the client enjoys excellent wireless link conditions. We find that benefits from compression are primarily realized under bad network conditions.\n\nGuided by our study, we design and implement Apollo, a framework that determines both when to use a middlebox and how to use it, based on the clients network conditions. First, Apollo selectively fetches objects on a web page either directly from the source or via a middlebox, rather than fetching all objects via the middlebox. Second, instead of simply performing lossless compression of all content, Apollo performs network-aware compression of images by selecting from among a range of content transformations. We implement and evaluate a prototype of Apollo using Googles open source Chromium mobile browser and compression proxy. Our extensive experiments show that, across a range of scenarios, Apollo reduces page load times for mobile clients by 3542% compared to the status quo."

Under the same framework, he considered that crime is bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life. The social effect on the occurrence of homicides has been previously substantiated, and confirmed here, in terms of a superlinear scaling relation: by doubling the population of a Brazilian city results in an average increment of 135% in the number of homicides, rather than the expected isometric increase of 100%, as found, for example, for the mortality due to car crashes. Here we present statistical signs of the social influence on the suicide occurrence in cities. Differently from homicides (superlinear) and fatal events in car crashes (isometric), we find sublinear scaling behavior between the number of suicides and city population, with allometric power-law exponents,  = 0.84  0.02 and 0.87  0.01, for all cities in Brazil and US counties, respectively. Also for suicides in US, but using the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), we obtain  = 0.88  0.01."

Using structuration theory, we applied the relational event framework to analyze how team members enacted sequential structural signatures (SSSs) in an experimental multiteam system (MTS). In the MTS, two groups of two individuals participated in a virtual scenario in which they were required to accomplish group and MTS level goals. Our results suggested that groups differ on the types of SSSs they created and that different SSSs are related to different outcomes. More specifically, when captains received the bulk of incoming messages and successfully relayed messages across squads, the squads were faster, more thorough, efficacious, and better coordinated. Additionally, when teams reciprocated messages and operated on similar temporal rhythms, they were initially better coordinated and more thorough. Qualitative interpretations, implications, and future work are discussed."

Due to the limitations of communication bandwidth, storage and processing capability, it is\na challenge to transfer the huge amount of crowdsourced\nphotos. To address this problem, we propose a framework,\ncalled SmartPhoto, to quantify the quality (utility) of crowd-\nsourced photos based on the accessible geographical and geometrical information (called metadata) including the smart-\nphones orientation, position and all related parameters of\nthe built-in camera. From the metadata, we can infer where\nand how the photo is taken, and then only transmit the\nmost useful photos. Three optimization problems regarding the tradeoffs between photo utility and resource constraints, namely the Max-Utility problem, the online Max-\nUtility problem and the Min-Selection problem, are stud-\nied. Efficient algorithms are proposed and their performance bounds are theoretically proved. We have implemented SmartPhoto in a testbed using Android based smart-\nphones, and proposed techniques to improve the accuracy\nof the collected metadata by reducing sensor reading errors\nand solving object occlusion issues. Results based on real\nimplementations and extensive simulations demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

        "abstract": "Timely and efficient message transmission through intermittently and sparsely connected networks is a problem of significant interest to the mobile networking community. Although the long-term statistics describing the time-varying connectivity in such networks can be characterized systematically and can be used for selecting good routes, it may be possible to achieve better performance by intelligently using the actual link states at the time of routing, in conjunction with these statistical dynamics models. In this paper, we investigate a family of minimum expected latency routing methods for such dynamic networks, spanning purely model-based and state-oblivious source routing; state-based source routing; and various flavors of dynamic (or hop-by-hop) routing, with increasing amounts of current link state knowledge around the source. \n\nFirst, we give a heuristic and an approximation scheme for the model-assisted source routing problem, as well as heuristics for the dynamic routing problem. Then we show using extensive simulations on both synthetic and real time-varying connectivity traces that although dynamically sampling link states helps to improve expected routing latency compared to source routing, the marginal improvements decline rapidly for knowledge of current link states beyond 2 hops. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough characterization of the performance of the entire spectrum of model-assisted routing algorithms ranging from little knowledge to complete knowledge of link dynamics.\n"

        "abstract": "Entity Disambiguation aims to link mentions of ambiguous names to a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia). An important evidence for this task is topical coherence, which assumes that information from the same semantic context tends to be topically-coherent. The paper presents a deep semantic relatedness model (DSRM) based on deep neural networks (DNN) and semantic knowledge graphs (KGs) to measure semantic relatedness between entities. We learn latent semantic entity representations through knowledge graph embeddings by encoding heterogeneous types of knowledge from KGs into DNN. The non-linear transformations of hierarchical hidden layers of DNN and the rich and clean knowledge from KGs allow deep semantic understanding of entities. We then propose an unsupervised graph regularization model (GraphRegu) to model topical coherence and perform collective entity disambiguation. Our experimental results on two publicly available datasets from both news and tweets demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches.\n"

Previous community detection methods look for uniform blocks in adjacency matrices. However, after studying four real networks with ground-truth communities, we provide empirical evidence that commu- nities are best represented as having an hyperbolic structure. We detail HyCoM - the Hyperbolic Community Model - as a better representation of communities and the relationships between their members, and show improvements in compression compared to standard methods. We also introduce HyCoM-FIT, a fast, parameter free algorithm to detect communities with hyperbolic structure. We show that our method is effective in finding communities with a similar structure to self-declared ones. We report findings in real social networks, including a community in a blogging platform with over 34 million edges in which more than 1000 users established over 300 000 relations."

        "abstract": "The Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpile process is an archetypal, stylized model of complex systems with a critical point as an attractor of their dynamics. This phenomenon, called self-organized criticality, appears to occur ubiquitously in both nature and technology. Initially introduced on the two-dimensional lattice, the BTW process has been studied on network structures with great analytical successes in the estimation of macroscopic quantities, such as the exponents of asymptotically power-law distributions. In this article, we take a microscopic perspective and study the inner workings of the process through both numerical and rigorous analysis. Our simulations reveal fundamental flaws in the assumptions of past phenomenological models, the same models that allowed accurate macroscopic predictions; we mathematically justify why universality may explain these past successes. Next, starting from scratch, we obtain microscopic understanding that enables mechanistic models; such models can, for example, distinguish a cascades area from its size. In the special case of a 3-regular network, we use self-consistency arguments to obtain a zero-parameter mechanistic (bottom-up) approximation that reproduces nontrivial correlations observed in simulations and that allows the study of the BTW process on networks in regimes otherwise prohibitively costly to investigate. We then generalize some of these results to configuration model networks and explain how one could continue the generalization. The numerous tools and methods presented herein are known to enable studying the effects of controlling the BTW process and other self-organizing systems. More broadly, our use of multitype branching processes to capture information bouncing back and forth in a network could inspire analogous models of systems in which consequences spread in a bidirectional fashion."

The objective is to infer the values of all nodes from that of a minimum subset of nodes by exploiting correlations in node values. We first introduce the concept of information dominating set (IDS). A subset of nodes in a given graph is an IDS if the value of these nodes is sufficient to infer the information state of the entire graph. We focus on two fundamentalalgorithmic problems: (i) how to determine whether a given subset of vertices is an IDS; (ii) how to construct a minimum IDS. Assuming binary node values and the local majority rule for information correlation, we show that the first problem is co-NP-complete and the second problem is NP-hard in a general network. We then show that in acyclic graphs, both problems admit linear-complexity solutions by establishing a connection between the IDS problems and the vertex cover problem. For general graphs, we develop efficient algorithms for solving both problems based on the concept of essential differential set. These results find applications in opinion sampling such as political polling and market survey in social-economic networks, and inferring epidemics and cascading failures in communication and infrastructure networks."

Our method learns the same model as an exact training algorithm would, but call the inference engine only in 10%  24% of the inference problems encountered during training.

Given a collection of text documents and a set of labels, we show that understanding the labels can be used to accurately categorize the documents. This is done by embedding both labels and documents in a semantic space that allows one to compute meaningful semantic similarity between a document and a potential label. We show that this scheme can be used to support accurate multiclass classification without any supervision. We study several semantic representations and show how to improve the classification using bootstrapping. Our results show that bootstrapped dataless classification is competitive with supervised classification with thousands of labeled examples."

We then show that the shortest path distance and\nas well as its sum is supermodular when the shortest path distance\nis restricted to use only one of the edges added. We argue that\nthis restriction does not significantly affect the results on realistic\ngraphs.

Multilayer networks have applications ranging from studying long-range connectivity in a communication or social network formed with hybrid technologies, a transportation network connecting the same cities via rail, road and air, in studying outbreaks of flu epidemics involving multiple viral strains, studying temporal flow of information in dynamic networks, and potentially in studying conductivity properties of graphene-like stacked lattices. For a homogenous multilayer network---formed via merging M random site-percolating instances of the same graph G with single-layer site-occupation probability q---we argue that when q exceeds a threshold $q_c(M)=\\\\Theta(1/\\\\sqrt{M})$, a spanning cluster appears in the multilayer network. Using a configuration model approach, we find $q_c(M)$ exactly for random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions, which have many applications in mathematical sociology. For multilayer percolation in a general graph G, we show that $q_c/\\\\sqrt{M} < q_c(M) < \\\\sqrt{-ln(1p_c)/M}$, for all positive integers M, where $q_c$ and $p_c$ are the site and bond percolation thresholds of G, respectively. We show a close connection between multilayer percolation and mixed (site-bond) percolation, since both provide a smooth bridge between pure-site and pure-bond percolations. We find excellent approximations and bounds on layered percolation thresholds for regular lattices using the aforesaid connection, and provide several exact results (via numerical simulations), and a specialized bound for the multilayer Kagome lattice using a site-to-bond transformation technique."

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the matter of inequality in network formation games. We employ a quantity that we are calling the Nash Inequality Ratio (NIR), defined as the maximal ratio between the highest and lowest costs incurred to individual agents in a Nash equilibrium strategy, to characterize the extent to which inequality is possible in equilibrium. We give tight upper bounds on the NIR for the network formation games of Fabrikant et al. (PODC 03) and Ehsani et al. (SPAA 11). With respect to the relationship between equality and social efficiency, we show that, contrary to common expectations, efficiency does not necessarily come at the expense of increased inequality."

        "abstract": "One of the Y5 NS CTA integrated experimentation themes was to explore methodologies for distributed experimentation. Under the theme of distributed experimentation, we worked with ARL and other CTA researchers to deploy a game for human-in-the-loop and cognitive agent-based experimentation into an online framework. Online access to the experimental game task and scenario will facilitate data collection from a larger pool of participants. In this work, we took a game that was designed for ARL human cognition and effectiveness research but not implemented for online experimentation, and translated it for deployment into the CTA Volunteer Science platform. This was the first time that external developers deployed to the Volunteer Science platform, and this game had more complex rules and scenario information than the previous Volunteer Science games.\n\nThis report documents screenshots of the implementation on the Volunteer Science site. It discusses the bot API as it stands now. This report concludes with options for future work on the Red-Blue IED Game, as well as potential enhancements to the Volunteer Science platform. The code for the game and demonstration bot have been delivered separately."

Quite often nodes participate in multiple communities; that is, communities can overlap. In this paper,\nwe first analyze what other researchers have done to utilize high performance computing to performefficient community detection\nin social, biological, and other networks. We note that detection of overlapping communities is more computationally intensive\nthan disjoint community detection, and the former presents new challenges that algorithm designers have to face. Moreover, the\nefficiency of many existing algorithms grows superlinearly with the network size making them unsuitable to process large datasets.\nWe use the Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA) as the basis for our parallel overlapping community detection\nimplementation. SLPA provides near linear time overlapping community detection and is well suited for parallelization.We explore\nthe benefits of a multithreaded programming paradigm and show that it yields a significant performance gain over sequential\nexecution while preserving the high quality of community detection. The algorithm was tested on four real-world datasets with up\nto 5.5 million nodes and 170 million edges. In order to assess the quality of community detection, at least 4 different metrics were\nused for each of the datasets."

        "abstract": "In present times when cameras are inexpensive and ubiquitous, processing vehicular traffic videos obtained from cameras on the road to obtain information is useful. These videos may be processed to extract information such as the volume of traffic on the road, to track particular vehicles in surveillance videos, to measure their speed in order to get traffic flow details, etc. The videos may be obtained from webcams perched on traffic signals, at the side of the road, or even from commuters who can take these videos using the camera on their cell-phones. These videos may then be processed on the devices recording them, to extract the required information. However, real-time video is usually generated at 30 frames per second (fps). If the recording device cannot process frames at a speed of at least 30 frames per second, it will customize the video by reducing its frame rate and the quality of the extracted information may decrease (QoI). If the user has a QoI requirement that will not be met even by reducing the frame rate on the recording device, the video must be streamed to a more powerful server which will be able to deliver the desired QoI by processing the video at the required frame rate. However, streaming these video files take up a lot of bandwidth. At times, the desired QoI may be met by lowering the frame rate, which may allow the video to be processed locally, or streaming the video at the reduced frame rate to a powerful server if the recording device cannot process the video at the lowered frame rate. This saves bandwidth as the video was either processed locally, or streamed to a powerful server at a reduced frame rate.\nThe difference in the QoI arising due to the limitations in processing powers on various devices was analyzed. Videos obtained from various traffic cameras were processed to extract information about the number of vehicles passing by in a certain amount of time, the color of vehicles, the type of vehicle, and the speed of the vehicles passing by. The videos could be processed on a server (with higher processing power) or an android phone (with less processing power). If the QoI (accuracy, precision) requirement may be met on the phone, the video is locally processed. However, when a QoI requirement may not be met on the phone, the formulated mathematical models show that less than the original frame rate may be sent to the server to meet the same QoI requirement. This work implements a system that helps decide when the video file can be locally processed to get a desired QoI compared to when the video (maybe with a lower frame rate) has to be streamed to an alternate powerful server, thereby saving many resources such as bandwidth and the battery charge on the phone."

        "abstract": "There is still much to discover about the mechanisms and nature of discontinuous percolation\ntransitions. Much of the past work considers graph evolution algorithms known as Achlioptas processes\nin which a single edge is added to the graph from a set of k randomly chosen candidate edges at each\ntimestep until a giant component emerges. Several Achlioptas processes seem to yield a discontinuous\npercolation transition, but it was proven by Riordan and Warnke that the transition must be continuous\nin the thermodynamic limit. However, they also proved that if the number k(n) of candidate edges increases\nwith the number of nodes, then the percolation transition may be discontinuous. Here we attempt to find\nthe simplest such process which yields a discontinuous transition in the thermodynamic limit. We introduce\na process which considers only the degree of candidate edges and not component size. We calculate the\ncritical point tc and the width of the critical window. The critical window is barely sublinear and hence the phase\ntransition is discontinuous but appears continuous in infinite systems. We also present arguments that\nAchlioptas processes with bounded size rules will always have continuous percolation transitions even with\ninfinite choice."

        "abstract": "The whole frame of interconnections in complex networks hinges on a specific set of structural nodes, much smaller than the total size, which, if activated, would cause the spread of information to the whole network, or, if immunized, would prevent the diffusion of a large scale epidemic. Localizing this optimal, that is, minimal, set of structural nodes, called influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science. Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders the problem remains unsolved. Here we map the problem onto optimal percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers, which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of the interactions is fixed by the nonbacktracking matrix of the network. Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large number of previously neglected weakly connected nodes emerges among the optimal influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. The present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous transition from a known phase."

        "abstract": "The problem of community detection has recently been studied widely in the context of the web and social media networks. Most algorithms for community detection assume that the entire network is available for online analysis. In practice, this is not really true, because only restricted portions of the network may be available at any given time for analysis. Many social networks such as Facebook have privacy constraints, which do not allow the discovery of the entire structure of the social network. Even in the case of more open networks such as Twitter, it may often be challenging to crawl the entire network from a practical perspective. For many other scenarios such as adversarial networks, the discovery of the entire network may itself be a costly task, and only a small portion of the network may be discovered at any given time. Therefore, it can be useful to investigate whether network mining algorithms can integrate the network discovery process tightly into the mining process, so that the best results are achieved for particular constraints on discovery costs. In this context, we will discuss algorithms for integrating community detection with network discovery. We will tightly integrate with the cost of actually discovering a network with the community detection process, so that the two processes can support each other and are performed in a mutually cohesive way. We present experimental results illustrating the advantages of the approach."

        "abstract": "Outlier or anomaly detection in large data sets is a fundamental task in data science, with broad applications. However, in real data sets with high-dimensional space, most outliers are hidden in certain dimensional combinations and are relative to a user's search space and interest. It is often more effective to give power to users and allow them to specify outlier queries flexibly, and the system will then process such mining queries efficiently. In this study, we introduce the concept of query-based outlier in heterogeneous information networks, design a query language to facilitate users to specify such queries flexibly, define a good outlier measure in heterogeneous networks, and study how to process outlier queries efficiently in large data sets. Our experiments on real data sets show that following such a methodology, interesting outliers can be defined and uncovered  flexibly and effectively in large heterogeneous networks."

        "abstract": "A/B testing, also known as bucket testing, split testing, or controlled experiment, is a standard way to evaluate user engagement or satisfaction from a new service, feature, or product. It is widely used in online websites, including social network sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to make data-driven decisions.The goal of A/B testing is to estimate the treatment effect of a new change, which becomes intricate when users are interacting, i.e., the treatment effect of a user may spill over to other users via underlying social connections. When conducting these online controlled experiments, it is a common practice to make the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). Though this assumption simplifies the estimation of treatment effect, it does not hold when network interference is present, and may even lead to wrong conclusion.\n\nIn this paper, we study the problem of network A/B testing in real networks, which have substantially different characteristics from the simulated random networks studied in previous works. We first examine the existence of network effect in a recent online experiment conducted at LinkedIn; Secondly, we propose an efficient and effective estimator for Average Treatment Effect (ATE) considering the interference between users in real online experiments; Finally, we apply our method in both simulations and a real world online experiment. The simulation results show that our estimator achieves better performance with respect to both bias and variance reduction. The real world online experiment not only demonstrates that large-scale network A/B test is feasible but also further validates many of our observations in the simulation studies."

        "abstract": "Although history may not repeat itself, many human activities are inherently periodic, recurring daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or following some other periods. Such recurring activities may not repeat the same set of keywords, but they do share similar topics. Thus it is interesting to mine topic periodicity from text data instead of just looking at the temporal behavior of a single keyword/phrase. Some previous preliminary studies in this direction prespecify a periodic temporal template for each topic. In this paper, we remove this restriction and propose a simple yet effective framework to mine periodic/recurrent patterns from text, such as news articles, search query logs, research papers, and web blogs. We first transform text data into topic-specific time series by a time dependent topic modeling module, where each of the time series characterizes the temporal behavior of a topic. Then we use time series techniques to detect periodicity. Hence we both obtain a clear view of how topics distribute over time and enable the automatic discovery of periods that are inherent in each topic. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the advantage of our method over existing work."

Application of the same types of analyses done in these studies to HINs requires additional considerations for handling integration of entities of different types and information propagation along differently typed links.

        "abstract": "Entity Taxonomy Construction is a process of identifying meaningful entities from text documents. In enterprises, constructing entity taxonomy improves enterprise efficiency by facilitating numerous applications, including search, recommendation, etc. However, the problem is particularly challenging on enterprise domains due to several reasons. First, the lack of redundancy of enterprise entities makes previous web-based systems like NELL and OpenIE not effective, since using only high-precision/low-recall patterns like those systems would miss the majority of sparse enterprise entities, while using more low-precision patterns in sparse setting also introduces noise drastically. Second, semantic drift is common in enterprises (Blue refers to Windows Blue), such that public signals from the web cannot be directly applied on entities. Moreover, many internal entities never appear on the web. Sparse internal signals are the only source for discovering them. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework for constructing entity taxonomy in enterprises, taking the input of enterprise corpus and limited seeds to generate a high-quality entity collection as output. We introduce the novel concept of Semantic Pattern Graph to leverage public signals to understand the underlying semantics of lexical patterns, reinforce pattern evaluation using mined semantics, and yield more accurate and complete entity taxonomy. Experiments\non Microsoft enterprise data shows the effectiveness of our approach."

The activities will provide the structure for multi-genre experimentation by extending prior single-genre experimentation, such as social/cognitive networks, through the addition of other genres, such as communications. This augmentation and establishment of experimentation structure will provide a context for experimentation prototyping and execution by genre experts, thereby also leading to increased human collaboration across genres, not just software artifacts of multiple genres.\n\nTo be specific, the activities will include:\n\\tMTSS/Groupscope extended to both social and communications genres\n\\tVirtual Battlespace extended to both social and communications genres\n\\tMulti-genre experimentation support identified by the X2 task\n\nThe extension to multiple genres will include EMANE incorporation and scenario configuration. The experimental structures will be instantiated on a copy of ARLs DAVC clustering whenever possible. The structures will also be instantiated on a copy of IBMs X1 clustering if possible. The existing social network science experiments are Microsoft Windows based, and some have significant real-time requirements. We have and will continue to identify cluster deployment requirements. If some requirements demand capabilities that cannot be delivered by DAVC or IBMs cluster in the X1 time frame, our work will nevertheless emphasize experimental results, multi-genre collaboration, and addressing mission challenges. This may imply prototyping some work with new hardware (e.g. virtualized GRID graphics adapters) in alternate clustering technology (Microsofts Hyper-V) in order to confirm detailed requirements and provide interim capabilities.\n"

We consider the case of an arbitrary number of opinions in the mean eld case of the naming game model in which it is assumed the population is infinite and all individuals are neighbors. A particular challenge of the naming game model is that the number of variables, which correspond to the number of possible sets of opinions, grows exponentially with the number of possible opinions. We present a method for generating mean eld dynamical equations for the general case of k opinions. We calculate the steady states in two important special cases in arbitrarily high dimension: the case in which there exist zealots of only one type, and the case in which there are an equal number of zealots for each opinion. We show that in these special cases a phase transition occurs at critical values pc of the parameter p describing the fraction of zealots. In the former case the critical value determines the threshold value beyond which it is not possible for the opinion with no zealots to be held by more nodes than the opinion with zealots, and this point remains fixed regardless of dimension. In the latter case, the critical point pc is the threshold value beyond which a stalemate between all k opinions is guaranteed, and we show that it decays precisely as a lognormal curve in k.\n"

Under the lens of structuration theory, we applied the relational event framework to analyze how team members enacted sequential structural signatures (SSSs) in an experimental multiteam system (MTS). In the MTS, two groups of two individuals participated in a virtual military-like scenario in which they were required to accomplish group and MTS level goals. Our results suggested that groups differ on the types of SSSs they created and that different SSSs are related to different outcomes. More specifically, when captains received the bulk of incoming messages and successfully relayed messages across squads, the squads were faster, more thorough, efficacious, and better coordinated. Additionally, when teams reciprocated messages and operated on similar temporal rhythms (i.e., no one team dominated communication), they were initially better coordinated and more thorough. Qualitative interpretations, implications, and future work are discussed"

        "abstract": "Leadership has been extensively discussed for a long time in the literature by describing the ideal traits of a leader, emphasizing the positive influence of the good leader on group, team, and organization performance. Although many different types and traits of leadership have been proposed, little work has considered the pivotal fact that the leader has limited capacity and resources (e.g., cognition, time, energy) when dealing with numerous time sensitive tasks in real, dynamic settings. This work is interested in how the leader can provide effective feedback to improve a followers team performance for establishing long-term assets in the team, while maximizing the utilization of limited resources. To this end, we adopt the Instance-Based Learning (IBL) cognitive architecture to develop a leadership framework that determines whether to provide feedback to a follower, and if so, how much feedback should be provided depending on the followers level of performance readiness. This proposed framework aims to maximize the trust improvement of followers, while minimizing the cost spent in providing feedback to achieve cost-effective decision making. By reflecting the concept of situational leadership, our proposed framework allows the leader to respond adaptively to followers based on their readiness. Our simulation results show that the proposed IBL-based framework provides an appropriate level of adaptive feedback depending on the readiness of a follower given no prior knowledge about the followers, while the leader can make cost-effective decision in feedback provision. Such cognitive leadership framework can be useful as a cognitive inspired decision aid tool for a human leader, or part of an autonomous and adaptive feedback system."

        "abstract": "In todays networks, individuals frequently face the problem of information overload. The amount of information available for a decision is often much larger than a person can process to make an informed decision. Past research has shown that individuals can differ significantly in how they use information in making decisions. Individuals may differ in their willingness to seek and incorporate more information into their decision making, some relying more on information at hand than simple heuristics. Individuals desire to reach a closure quickly by making a decision may differ as well, depending on situational factors such as the level of inherent ambiguity or uncertainty in the decision. These factors have not yet been studied deeply in the context of networked information processing in terms of their impact on the timeliness and accuracy of decisions. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an agent-based model that incorporates four characteristics representing individual differences: competence, engagement, decisiveness and reliance on neighbors opinions for corroboration. Based on a novel way of modeling the degree of problem difficulty, we investigate the impact of individual differences in networked decision making through comprehensive simulation experiments. Our simulation results show that being more engaged with a task does not always improve team performance and can lead to information overload if it is coupled with high information push activity. Similarly, heuristic decisions as a result of high decisiveness can be useful in various problem settings and can be further improved by a small amount of corroboration."

These systems are important components of many modern organizations, from military to business to emergency response. This study presents a novel approach to understanding how the performance of a multiteam system is impacted by the underlying behavioral patterns of individuals. Specifically, we examine how groups or clusters are formed over time. Small communities within a broader system represent cohesive units that communicate, coordinate, and plan more effectively than the group as a whole. The composition of these units, relative to the predefined roles within the multiteam system, can affect outcomes at both the proximal and distal levels. Data is collected from a series of 17 experiments in which participants played a simulated war game and communicated electronically. In order to accommodate this unique data source  a series of time-stamped interactions  we apply a novel method for identifying communities within social networks in which the observable data is entirely transactional. Using the results of this analytical framework, we develop metrics which represent behavioral patterns within the multiteam system. These measures strongly predict performance at both the team and system level, which we illustrate via a series of regression models."

The intent is to support research that helps\nthe Army address mission challenges, and thereby leads to improved field operations.\n\nPrior single-genre human-in-the-loop team studies used near-perfect communications networks since the\nexperiments were performed on reliable high-bandwidth civilian networks. However, military tactical networks\nare wireless, resource-limited, and unreliable. They suffer from low bandwidth, significant packet loss,\nand connectivity outages. X1 introduced tactical network modeling so that research can properly evaluate social\ninteractions and communications technology, and study their intertwined impact on mission performance\nvia multi-genre experimentation.\n\nWe envision human subjects participating in a multi-genre experiment are at workstations, connected by a\nnetwork to a cluster on which the experiment is deployed. Each user is supported by a user-specific collection\nof processes, which in this example includes graphics and audio for a participant moving within a training\nscenario in a virtual world. The virtual world is coordinated by communication among the processes, sharing\nlocations and events such as shots fired, which occurs via a back-end network. The interaction of\nthe participants is the social science focus, and occurs via voice and other packets passing over a simulated\ntactical network that instantiates the communications science focus. To be scientific, rather than\nanecdotal, the experiment may need to be run many times, with participants changing roles, and with varying\nparticipant populations. This deploy once, experiment many times and places approach is a direct and\nsimple instantiation for that need.\n\nTask achievements include:\n- Multi-Team System Simulation (MTSS) extended to both social and communications genres\n- Analysis of distributed experimentation alternatives (DAVC, OpenStack), recommending DAVC as more appropriate for communications simulation than the service-oriented OpenStack (Appendix F).\n- Identification of requirements for distributed experimentation framework software, supported by concrete NS CTA research examples (Appendix E).\n\nX1 created the experimental infrastructure required for multi-genre network science research into complex\nenvironments. This enables NS CTA researchers to address far more realistic and military-relevant\nexperimental domains, with greater validity, relevance, and scientific insight."

Nodes in such systems will need to exchange large volumes of declarative information, including ontologies and logical theories. In this paper, we describe our ini-tial work on a system for compressed two-way communication of simplified logical inferences.

We also present a new protocol that achieves significant speedup, at the cost of reduced compression."

        "abstract": "The matching hypothesis in social psychology claims that people are more likely to form a committed relationship with someone equally attractive. Previous works on stochastic models of human mate choice process indicate that patterns supporting the matching hypothesis could occur even when similarity is not the primary consideration in seeking partners. Yet, most if not all of these works concentrate on fully-connected systems. Here we extend the analysis to networks. Our results indicate that the correlation of the couple's attractiveness increases monotonically with the increased average degree and decreased degree diversity of the network. This correlation is lower in sparse networks than in fully-connected systems, because in the former less attractive individuals who find partners are likely to be coupled with ones who are more attractive than them. The chance of failing to be matched decreases exponentially with both the attractiveness and the degree. The matching hypothesis may not hold when the degree-attractiveness correlation is present, which can give rise to negative correlation in attractiveness between couples. Finally, we find that the ratio between the number of matched couples and the size of the maximum matching varies non-monotonically with the average degree of the network."

        "abstract": "The spread of opinions in social networks is dependent on structural properties of the network and the individual characteristics of its nodes. To capture this dependence, several abstract models of such spread were proposed. First, we model the difference between the dynamics of opinion spread in communities with a static social network versus a dynamic social network. Here we use the theoretical model of spread of opinions called the Binary Agreement Model based on the naming game. Using this model, we study potential mechanisms for the dependencies observed in the data by matching model generated evolution of opinion with the empirically observed evolution in the data.  Second, we examine the unique set of behavioral network data (based on electronic logs of dyadic contact via smartphones) collected at the University of Notre Dame. The participants are a sample of members of the entering class of freshmen in the fall of 2011 whose opinions on a wide variety of political and social issues have been regularly recordedat the beginning and end of each semesterfor the last three years. Using this data set, we measure the evolution of participants' opinions and ascertain how much this evolution depends on the cultural traits of individuals and the structural properties of social networks that they form. Our analysis of our empirical dataset shows that ties among people who are more likely to share opinions (e.g. same race, gender, or socioeconomic class) decay at a slower rate than ties among persons who are likely to have different opinions. The analysis also indicates that the partner selection of individuals is associated sharing a (political) opinion. These results offer an assessment of the level of impact of culture and social network dynamics on the evolution of opinions in multi-cultural social networks."

Exemplar\noutcomes of this shift are a wide range of graph data such as information, social, and knowledge graphs. The unique characteristics of graph data are challenging traditional search techniques like SQL and keyword search.  Graph query is emerging as a promising complementary search form. In this paper, we study how to improve graph query by relevance feedback. Specifically, we focus on knowledge graph query, and formulate the graph relevance feedback (GRF) problem. We propose a general GRF framework that\nis able to (1) tune the original ranking function based on user feedback and (2) further enrich the query itself by mining new features from user feedback. As a consequence, a query-specific ranking function is generated, which is better aligned with the user search intent. Given a newly learned ranking function based on user feedback, we further investigate whether we shall re-rank the existing answers, or choose to search from scratch. We propose a strategy to train a binary classifier to predict which action will be more beneficial\nfor a given query. The GRF framework is applied to searching DBpedia with graph queries derived from YAGO and Wikipedia. Experiment results show that GRF can improve the mean average precision by 80% to 100%."

To capture the complex nature\nof social influencing we investigate numerically and analytically the transition in the behavior of threshold-limited cascades  in the\npresence of multiple initiators as the distribution of thresholds is varied between the two extreme cases of identical thresholds to a\nuniform distribution. We accomplish this by employing a truncated normal distribution of the nodes' thresholds and observe a\nnon-monotonic change in the cascade size as we vary the standard deviation. Further, for a sufficiently large spread in the threshold\ndistribution, the tipping-point behavior of the social influencing process disappears and is replaced by a smooth crossover governed by\nthe size of initiator set. We demonstrate that for a given size of the initiator set, there is a specific variance of the threshold\ndistribution for which an opinion spreads optimally. Furthermore, in the case of synthetic graphs we show that the spread asymptotically\nbecomes independent of the system size, and that global cascades can arise just by the addition of a single node to the\ninitiator set."

Theoretical studies show that in such multiplex networks, correlated edge dynamics between the layers can have a profound effect on dynamical processes. However, how to extract the correlations from real-world systems is an outstanding challenge. This work provides a null model based on Markov chains to quantify correlations in edge dynamics found in longitudinal data of multiplex networks. We use this approach on two different data sets: the network of trade and alliances between nation states, and the email and co-commit networks between developers of open source software. We establish the existence of dynamical spillover showing the correlated formation (or deletion) of edges of different types as the system evolves. The details of the dynamics over time provide insight into potential causal pathways."

The first problem\nasks to partition the graph into k vertex disjoint paths of length 2 (referred to as 2-paths) such that the total weight of the paths is maximized. We present a cubic time approximation algorithm that computes a 2-path partition whose total weight is at least .5833 of the weight of an optimal partition; improving upon the (.5265 epsilon)-approximation algorithm of [24]. Restricting the input graph to have edge weights in {0, 1}, we present a .75 approximation algorithm improving upon the .55-approximation algorithm of [14]. Combining this algorithm with a previously known approximation algorithm for the 3-Set Packing problem, we obtain a .6-approximation algorithm for the problem of partitioning a {0, 1}-edge-weighted graph into k vertex disjoint triangles of maximum total weight. The best known approximation algorithm for general weights achieves an approximation ratio of .5257 [4].\n"

        "abstract": "Online social communities often exhibit complex relationship structures, ranging from close friends to political rivals. As a result, persons are influenced by their friends and foes differently. Future network applications can benefit from integrating these structural differences in propagation schemes through socially aware sensors. In this paper, we introduce a propagation model for such social sensor networks with positive and negative relationship types. We tackle two main scenarios based on this model. The first one is to minimize the end-to-end propagation cost of influencing a target person in favor of an idea by utilizing sensor observations about the relationship types in the underlying social graph. The propagation cost is incurred by social and physical network dynamics such as propagation delay, frequency of interaction, the strength of friendship/foe ties or the impact factor of the propagating idea. We next extend this problem by incorporating the impact of message deterioration and ignorance, and by limiting the number of persons influenced against the idea before reaching the target. Second, we study the propagation problem while minimizing the number of negatively influenced persons on the path, and provide extensions to elaborate on the impact of network parameters. We demonstrate our results in both an artificially created network and the Epinions signed network topology. Our results show that judicious propagation schemes lead to a significant reduction in the average cost and complexity of network propagation compared to naive myopic algorithms."

NoTs arise in several contexts such as large software projects, sensors cooperating for target tracking, and terrorist cell networks. Modeling a NoT as a simplicial complex, we consider the problem of quantifying the strength of a NoT using metrics based purely on its structure. While the design of a metric clearly depends on the context in question, most applications require the metric to be monotonic. We define three kinds of monotonicity  weak, team, and structural  depending upon whether we add/remove nodes, entire teams, or facets, respectively We propose seven metrics and analyze their monotonicity, both mathematically and experimentally. Specifically, we prove that some metrics or monotonic, and show that some or not by providing counter examples. For nonmonotonic metrics, we generate random simplicial complexes using a number of models, and estimate the fraction of cases for which a metric is not monotonic."

        "abstract": "Observing and controlling complex networks are of paramount interest for understanding complex physical, biological and technological systems. Recent studies have made important advances in identifying sensor or driver nodes, through which we can observe or control a complex system. Yet, the observational uncertainty induced by measurement noise and the energy required for control continue to be significant challenges in practical applications. Here we show that the variability of control energy and observational uncertainty for different directions of the state space depend strongly on the number of driver nodes. In particular, we find that if all nodes are directly driven, control is energetically feasible, as the maximum energy increases sublinearly with the system size. If, however, we aim to control a system from a single node, control in some directions is energetically prohibitive, increasing exponentially with the system size. For the cases in between, the maximum energy decays exponentially when the number of driver nodes increases. We validate our findings in several model and real networks, arriving to a series of fundamental laws that describe the control energy that together deepen our understanding of complex systems."

(2) Can we separate these cues from the content and quantify their influence on credibility perception?, and (3) To what extent is such a quantification portable across different microblogging platforms? To answer the third question, we study two popular microblogs, Reddit and Twitter.

The interaction technique draws on ideas from 3D modeling, mesh deformation, and static graph drawing to promote discovery of hidden in- formation across a wide variety of graph types and analysis tasks. The key innovation of this work is the application of methods traditionally reserved for automated graph layout and clustering, to produce useful task-specific layout through dynamic interactions. Graph nodes are dynamically repositioned using an interpolated decay function over a single node movement provided by a user. We describe several variants of the interpolation method, including coupling it with a fast local-cut algorithm for cluster selection. Compared to traditional layout mechanisms the technique is particularly useful when meta-data nodes are added to a graph, increasing its connectivity. We show how the techniques can be used inter- actively to solve text analysis tasks including a case study on a collection of 16K awarded NSF grant proposals with meta- data and a corpus of New York Times news articles."

        "abstract": "Centrality of a node measures its relative importance within a network. There are a number of applications of centrality, including inferring the influence or success of an individual in a social network, and the resulting social network dynamics. While we can compute the centrality of any node in a given network snapshot, a number of applications are also interested in knowing the potential importance of an individual in the future. However, current centrality is not necessarily an effective predictor of future centrality. While there are different measures of centrality, we focus on degree centrality in this paper. We develop a method that reconciles preferential attachment and triadic closure to capture a nodes prominence profile. We show that the proposed node prominence profile method is an effective predictor of degree centrality. Notably, our analysis reveals that individuals in the early stage of evolution display a distinctive and robust signature in degree centrality trend, adequately predicted by their prominence profile. We evaluate our work across four real-world social networks. Our findings have important implications for the applications that require prediction of a nodes future degree centrality, as well as the study of social network dynamics.\n"

        "abstract": "Scientific impact plays a central role in the evaluation of the out- put of scholars, departments, and institutions. A widely used mea- sure of scientific impact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting the number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of such predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law distribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are extremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare. Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked by many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: Will this paper increase my h-index? Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7 million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific impact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to increase the primary authors h-index. We find that the researchers authority on the publication topic and the venue in which the pa- per is published are crucial factors to the increase of the primary authors h-index, while the topic popularity and the co-authors h- indices are of surprisingly little relevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5% potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an authors h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current h-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification of scientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and more effectively leverage their position of standing on the shoulders of giants.

        "abstract": "Social status, defined as the relative rank or position that an individual holds in a social hierarchy, is known to be among the most important motivating forces in social behaviors. In this paper, we consider the notion of status from the perspective of a position or title held by a person in an enterprise. We study the intersection of social status and social networks in an enterprise. We study whether enterprise communication logs can help reveal how social interactions and individual status manifest themselves in social networks. To that end, we use two enterprise datasets with three communication channels  voice call, short message, and email  to demonstrate the social-behavioral differences among individuals with different status. We have several interesting findings and based on these findings we also develop a model to predict social status. On the individual level, high-status individuals are more likely to be spanned as structural holes by linking to people in parts of the enterprise networks that are otherwise not well connected to one another. On the community level, the principle of homophily, social balance and clique theory generally indicate a rich club maintained by high-status individuals, in the sense that this community is much more connected, balanced and dense. Our model can predict social status of individuals with\n93% accuracy."

Social influence is believed to drive both off-line and on-line human behavior, however it has not been considered as a driver of social network evolution. Our analysis suggest that, while the network structure affects the spread of influence in social networks, the network is in turn shaped by social influence activity. To that end, we develop a novel model of network evolution where the dynamics of network follow the mechanism of influence propagation, which are not captured by the existing network evolution models. Our experiments confirm the predictions of our model and demonstrate the important role that social influence can play in the process of network evolution. As well exploring the reason of social network evolution, different genres of social influence have been spotted having different effects on the network dynamics. These findings and methods are essential to both our understanding of the mechanisms that drive network evolution and our knowledge of the role of social influence in shaping the network structure."

        "abstract": "Most  successful  Entity  Linking  (EL)  methods aim to link mentions to their referent entities  in  a  structured  Knowledge  Base  (KB) by  comparing  their  respective  contexts,  often using similarity measures.  While the KB structure is given,  current methods have suffered  from  impoverished  information  representations on the mention side.  In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Abstract Meaning  Representation  (AMR)  (Banarescu et al., 2013) to select high quality sets of entity collaborators to feed a simple similarity measure (Jaccard) to link entity mentions. Experimental results show that AMR captures contextual properties discriminative enough to make linking decisions, without the need for EL training data, and that system with AMR parsing output outperforms hand labeled traditional semantic roles as context representation for EL. Finally,  we show promising preliminary results for using AMR to select sets of coherent entity mentions for collective entity linking.\n"

For example, Black Mamba, the name for a highly venomous snake, is a morph that Kobe Bryant created for himself due to his agility and aggressiveness in playing basketball games. This paper presents the first end-to-end context-aware entity morph decoding system that can automatically identify, disambiguate, verify morph mentions based on specific contexts, and resolve them to target entities. Our approach is based on an absolute cold-start - it does not require any candidate morph or target entity lists as input, nor any manually constructed morph-target pairs for training. We design a semi-supervised collective\ninference framework for morph mention extraction, and compare various deep learning based approaches for morph resolution.\nOur approach achieved significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method (Huang et al., 2013), which used a large amount of training data.\n"

        "abstract": "Small Group evolution has been of central importance in social sciences and also in the industry for understanding dynamics of team formation. While most of research works studying groups deal at a macro level with evolution of arbitrary size communities, in this paper we restrict ourselves to studying evolution of small group (size <= 20) which is governed by contrasting sociological phenomenon. Given a previous history of group collaboration between a set of actors, we address the problem of predicting likely future group collaborations. Unfortunately, predicting groups requires choosing from (n r) possibilities (where r is group size and n is total number of actors), which becomes computationally intractable as group size increases. However, our statistical analysis of a real world dataset has shown that two processes are largely responsible for future group formation. This helps to drastically reduce the(n r)\npossibilities. We used DBLP, a popular research collaboration dataset, to discover these two phenomena. We found that, given a 3 year training and 3 year testing window of DBLP dataset, on an average upto 20% groups in test period are formed when an actor joins an existing group in training period and up to 70% groups are result of when an actor joins subset of a training set group. We therefore, model the attachment of a group for different actors outside this group. We address two different group accretion problems. The first is incremental accretion (IA) in which, given a group, we rank actors outside the group with their likelihood to collaborate with all the actors in this group. Second is the problem of subgroup accretion (SA) where we rank external actors by their likelihood to collaborate with a subset of actors from this group. These rankings are then aggregated to predict future groups formed by these two processes. In this paper, we have built three topology based prediction models to study these phenomena. The performance of those models is evaluated using extensive experiments over DBLP dataset. Our prediction results shows that the proposed models are significantly useful for future group predictions both in IA and SA."

        "abstract": "The manner in which individuals communicate, coordinate, and lead within a multiteam system (MTS) directly relates to the success of the MTS at the local and system level (Davison, Hollenbeck, Barnes, Sleesman, and Ilgen, 2012; Bienefeld and Grote, 2013; DeChurch & Marks, 2006; Mathieu, Marks, & Zaccaro, 2001). In order to identify attributes of successful MTS, Zaccaro, Marks, and DeChurch (2011) identified compositional, linkage, and developmental attributes as the core dimensions along which a multiteam system may differ. Of particular interest are linkage attributes, including the interdependence of component teams, the hierarchical arrangement of teams, the power distribution among components, and the communication structure or network of teams (Zaccaro et al., 2011). These elements can be examined via two distinct lenses. First, the structure and patterns of communication can be used to find cohesive bonds among individuals, identify channels through which information passes, and highlight the integration of leadership within and between component teams. Second, the content of communication within and between teams has a direct impact on the effectiveness of team processes (Marks, Mathieu, & Zaccaro, 2001). In particular, the meaning, intent, and weight of a message greatly influences the manner in which individuals behave.\n\nWe have identified two distinct dimensions of team and group communication, structure and content. Structural analysis of communication can reveal significant information about who contacts who, how information is spread, and how active individuals are in engaging fellow team members. Semantic analysis highlights the context of communication and gives an insight into the intent of interpersonal behavior. The research goal of this study is to understand how each of these methods relate to the effectiveness of multiteam systems. Additionally, we intend to marry these two unique approaches to provide a richer understanding of the behavioral processes of MTS and how these emergent patterns relate to performance.\n"

        "abstract": "Relationships are inherently dynamic; they start, stop, and change over time. As a consequence, the notion of a binary link between two individuals fails to capture the richness and complexity of interpersonal relations. Longitudinal network analysis, specifically actor-oriented models, determine how individuals craft their networks over time as a result of some underlying objective function. However, this approach only utilizes discrete observations of static networks. Given the rise of time-stamped event data, more granular statistical methods are required to leverage the information gained when every interaction can be observed. The relational event framework remedies that methodological gap. This model is a statistical tool for analyzing sequences of dyadic interactions and identifying emergent drivers of interpersonal action. \n\nWhile relationships cannot be viewed as static entities, they also cannot be viewed as one dimensional. Rather, interactions can be classified by their content, their affect, their method of delivery, or numerous other categories. While the original model was derived to handle multiple classes of relations, there has not been significant investigation into the implementation of a multi-relational event method or the resulting theoretical implications. In this study we address this issue through an explicit formulation of the relational event model which incorporates multiple types of dyadic actions. Additionally, we advance the notion of the multi-level sequential structural signature in the context of various relational classes. Specifically, we explain how the interplay of multiple dynamic interpersonal processes can predict future behaviors of any type. \n\nOur approach will be illustrated in the context of channel selection within a multi-team system (MTS) communication network. This study will make use of interpersonal communications from a large-scale series of experiments; data was collected from 17 laboratory sessions simulating a multi-team system scenario, each involving 20 unique participants (340 total individuals). During the experiment, individuals were able to communicate via text, which is a low richness channel, or audio, which is a high richness channel. We posit that the sequence, direction, and timing of interactions over each communication channel can be used to predict the efficacy of a MTS. Specifically, we hypothesize that the emergent behavioral trends that drive channel selection will reflect how effectively teams coordinate internally, teams coordinate externally, and leadership is expressed.\n"

        "abstract": "We propose an approach to model the communication patterns within a multi-team system (MTS) which accounts for the frequency of interaction event patterns .  The proposed model builds on the Hawkes process, whose intensity function depends on the entire past history and is self-exciting . Such point process models are widely used in seismology, neurophysiology, epidemiology, and in reliability analysis. The central idea of self-exciting point process models is that any aggregation of discrete events can be divided into background events and foreground events, where the background events constitute the statistically independent events and the foreground events account for the events that have significant temporal dependencies. Since the background events are statistically independent of one another, they neither increase nor decrease the chance of another background event occurring in the future. On the other hand, foreground events are statistically dependent on prior occurrences and thus they increase the chance of future event occurrences. Therefore, the intensity of the self-exciting point process consists of two terms, one accounting for the background rate and the other corresponding to the self-exciting rate or the foreground event rate. Self-exciting point processes are typically used in analyzing a single event type. On the contrary, here we use the self-exciting point process to model the occurrences of multiple event types. In doing so, we capture the self-excitation as well as the inter-event excitation phenomena, where the occurrence of event A may trigger the occurrence of event B in a future time . More specifically, we utilize the modified self-exciting point process to model the communication patterns within a MTS setting, where each component team consists of a single leader and several followers. Within such a multi-team setup, there are five different communication events that can occur: (i) inter-team leader-leader interaction, (ii) inter-team leader-follower interaction, (iii) inter-team follower-follower interaction, (iv) intra-team leader-follower interaction, and (v) intra-team follower-follower interaction. While the occurrence of a particular communication event could result in future occurrences of same event, it could also result in an episode of any of the remaining four interactions. Thus, we modified the traditional self-exciting point process to account for both the self-excitation as well as the inter-event excitation phenomena.  "

Therefore, we use a library of human-generated annotations in a novel search and retrieval based setting to track objects in an unseen video sequence. For every video sequence, a document that represents motion information is generated. The documents of the unseen video are queried against the library at multiple scales to find videos with similar motion characteristics. This provides us with coarse localization of objects in the unseen video. We further adapt these retrieved object locations to the new video using an efficient warping scheme.

        "abstract": "The paper describes a novel algorithm for timely sensor data retrieval in resource-poor environments under fresh- ness constraints. Consider a civil unrest, national security, or disaster management scenario, where a dynamic situation evolves and a decision-maker must decide on a course of action in view of latest data. Since the situation changes, so is the best course of action. The scenario offers two interesting constraints. First, one should be able to successfully compute the course of action within some appropriate time window, which we call the decision deadline. Second, at the time the course of action is computed, the data it is based on must be fresh (i.e., within some corresponding validity interval). We call it the freshness constraint. These constraints create an interesting novel problem of timely data retrieval. We address this problem in resource- scarce environments, where network resource limitations require that data objects (e.g., pictures and other sensor measurements pertinent to the decision) generally remain at the sources. Hence, one must decide on (i) which objects to retrieve and (ii) in what order, such that the cost of deciding on a valid course of action is minimized while meeting data freshness and decision deadline constraints. Such an algorithm is reported in this paper. The algorithm is shown in simulation to reduce the cost of data retrieval compared to a host of baselines that consider time or resource constraints. It is applied in the context of minimizing cost of finding unobstructed routes between specified locations in a disaster zone by retrieving data on the health of individual route segments."

        "abstract": "There are numerous environments and situations where network infrastructure is sparse, latent, or partially out of service. There is a growing body of research on protocols, security, information assurance and trust for use in such Resource Constrained Networks. A few examples of a Resource Constrained Network include Delay Tolerant, Wireless Sensor, and many mobile ad-hoc and ad-hoc mesh networks. Data fusion of direct observations and recommendations from other nodes into an aggregate trust value on a given node allows for more efficient routing and enables information assurance security services that support data availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Selecting proper data metrics and fusion scheme allows nodes in a network to quickly converge on an accurate trust value for a given node. This minimizes security risks and provides better quality of service to properly functioning nodes as well as quickly isolates malicious ones. This paper discusses our current work on distributed trust management schemes for use in Resource Constrained Networks. Specifically, it introduces fusion methods to integrate diverse clues into a composite trust value."

        "abstract": "Real-world networks often consist of multiple layers,\nbe they infrastructure such as airline networks or social such as\ncollaboration networks. A common aspect to these networks is\nthat there are multiple sub-networks that evolve in parallel on\nthe same node set  these are referred to as multiplex networks.\nFor example, in the case of airline networks, the cities (nodes)\nhave been well-established for several decades if not centuries,\nbut over time new airlines (sub-networks) emerge and each\nairline creates its own flight linkages between cities. Similarly\nmultiple modalities of communications evolve in parallel between\nindividuals (nodes) such as E-mail, SMS, and Online Social\nNetworks, e.g., Facebook and Twitter. While in some multiplex\nnetworks, each layer evolves independently from other layers\nover time, in other multiple networks, the evolution of a layer is\ncoupled with that of other layers  a process referred to as coevolution.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel generative model,\nBINBALL, for a class of multiplex networks whose structure\nmay co-evolve (that is, depend on as well as influence) the\nstructure of the individual networks. We validate our model\nusing a multiplex data set for the European Air Transportation\nNetwork (EATN). We also investigate questions regarding the\nalgorithmic complexity of finding short paths through multiplex\nnetworks as well as coverage of nodes using a minimum number\nof layers. We show that while certain problems in this space\ncan be solved in polynomial time, others are NP hard. Among\nthe latter, some problems are approximable, whereas others are\nnot. Finally, we demonstrate that BINBALL is a good generative\nmodel since it is able to generate random networks whose degree\nas well as path length distributions closely match those of the\nEATN."

When a network operates in a contested environment, the operator may wish to alter the network topology to enhance robustness. This may come at the expense of operational costs. We consider a dynamic programming framework where the goal is to minimize time average costs, where costs are the sum of network properties (e.g. eccentricity), edit costs and maintenance costs. We consider practical low-complexity control algorithms which focus on instantaneous network states. We particularly introduce a modified myopic policy which attempts to reduce average cost by benefiting future costs. We also provide decision rules for different algorithms and characterize expected costs for random hostility models. Our numerical results demonstrate that our modified myopic scheduler outperform other schedulers in terms of average sum cost for various settings."

        "abstract": "There are numerous environments or situations where a computer network has one or more constraints. Impact of these constraints can range from minimal user inconveniences to catastrophic reduction of capabilities. These constraints allow availability of information at the cost of abandoning the safety and reliability of traditional routing and security protocols. A number of environments in which such networks are needed include those present in military battlefields, first responder missions or remote environments. Resource Constraint Networks (RCN) are a class of networks capable of working in such austere environments. Delay Tolerant, Wireless Sensor, and some mobile and mesh ad-hoc networks fall under the broader definition of RCN. In order to provide additional information assurance (IA) security services above information availability such as integrity, confidentiality, and authentication require significant modification to traditional routing and security protocols. One method is to manage trust in a distributed manner in order to make valid trust values available to a node. Using them, a node can then make decisions on how and when to forward a message through the network. While not traditional authentication, distributed trust can be used as a probabilistic proxy, and allow for more secure transmission of information from source to destination in a RCN. The use of path information in a DTN allows for malicious node detection.We show how using erasure coding, complete path information, and inferences assist in better identifying malicious nodes in a DTN."

        "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is the de-facto standard for gathering annotated data.  While, in theory, data annotation tasks are assumed to be attempted by workers independently, in practice, data annotation tasks are often grouped into batches to be presented and annotated by workers together, in order to save on the time or cost overhead of providing instructions or necessary background.  Thus, even though independence is usually assumed between annotations on data items within the same batch, in most cases, a workers judgment on a data item can still be affected by other data items within the batch, leading to additional errors in collected labels.  In this paper, we study the data annotation bias when data items are presented as batches to be judged by workers simultaneously.  We propose a novel worker model to characterize the annotating behavior on data batches, and present how to train the worker model on annotation data sets.  We also present a debiasing technique to remove the effect of such annotation bias from adversely affecting the accuracy of labels obtained.  Our experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve up to +57% improvement in F1-score compared to the standard majority voting baseline.\n"

        "abstract": "We witness an unprecedented proliferation of knowledge graphs that record millions of heterogeneous entities and their diverse relationships. While knowledge graphs are structure-flexible and content-rich, it is difficult to query them. The challenge lies in the gap\nbetween their overwhelming complexity and the limited database knowledge of non-professional users. If writing structured queries over simple tables is difficult, it gets even harder to query complex knowledge graphs. As an initial step toward improving the usability of knowledge graphs, we propose to query such data by example entity tuples, without requiring users to write complex graph queries. Our system, GQBE (Graph Query By Example), is a proof of concept to show the possibility of this querying paradigm working in practice. The proposed framework automatically derives a hidden query graph based on input query tuples and finds approximate matching answer graphs to obtain a ranked list of top-k answer tuples. It also makes provisions for users to give feedback on the presented top-k answer tuples. The feedback is used to refine the query graph to better capture the user intent. We conducted initial experiments on the real-world Freebase dataset, and observed appealing accuracy and efficiency. Our proposal of querying by example tuples provides a complementary approach to the existing keyword-based and query-graph-based methods, facilitating user friendly graph querying. To the best of our knowledge, GQBE is among the first few emerging systems to query knowledge graphs by example entity tuples."

How to model the proficiency of experts is critical for us to understand and optimize collaborative networks. Traditional expertise models, such as topic\nmodel based methods, cannot capture two aspects of human expertise simultaneously: Specialization (what area an expert is good at?) and Proficiency Level (to what degree?). In this paper, we propose new models to overcome this problem. We embed all historical\ntask data in a lower dimension space and learn vector representations of expertise based on both solved and unsolved tasks. \n\nSpecifically, in our first model, we assume that each expert will only handle tasks whose difficulty level just matches his/her proficiency level, while experts in the second model accept tasks whose levels are equal to or lower than his/her proficiency level. Experiments on real world datasets show that both models outperform topic model based approaches and standard classifiers such as logistic regression and support vector machine in terms of prediction accuracy. The learnt vector representations can be used to compare expertise in a\nlarge organization and optimize expert allocation."

        "abstract": "We demonstrate the role of sociocultural factors in understanding opinion dynamics. As a baseline, we initially assess theoretical models of opinion spread whose parameters are dependent on sociocultural factors. Such models use the structural properties of the network and the individual characteristics of nodes. First, we model the difference between the dynamics of opinion spread in communities with a static social network versus a dynamic social network. The theoretical models of the spread of opinions used here is the Binary Agreement Model (BAM) and Threshold Model. For both, we examine potential mechanisms for the dependencies observed in the data by matching model generated evolution of opinion with the empirically observed evolution in the data. Second, we examine the unique set of behavioral network data on social interactions (based on electronic logs of dyadic contact via smartphones) collected at the University of Notre Dame. The participants are a sample of members of the entering class of freshmen in the fall of 2011 whose opinions on a wide variety of political and social issues have been regularly recordedat the beginning and end of each semesterfor the last three years. Using this data set, we measure the evolution of participants' opinions and ascertain the quantitative dependence on the cultural traits of individuals and the structural properties of social networks that they form. Our analysis of an empirical dataset shows that ties among people who are more likely to share opinions (e.g. of the same race, gender, or socioeconomic class) decay slower than ties among persons who are likely to have different opinions. The analysis also indicates that the partner selection of individuals is correlated with sharing a (political) opinion. Results show sociocultural factors and social network dynamics both influence the evolution of opinions in multicultural social networks. "

Using this model, we study through simulations, the effect of the extent of user attention on the probability that the cascade becomes viral. In analogy with a branching process, we estimate the branching factor associated with the cascade process for different attention spans and different forwarding probabilities, and demonstrate that beyond a certain attention\nspan, critical forwarding probabilities exist that constitute a threshold after which cascades can become viral. The critical forwarding probabilities have an inverse relationship with the attention span. Next, we develop a semi-analytical approach for our model, that allows us determine the branching factor for given values of message generation rates, message forwarding rates and attention spans. The branching factors obtained using this analytical approach show good agreement with those obtained through simulations. Finally, we analyze an event specific data set obtained from Twitter, and show that estimated branching factors correlate well with the cascade\nsize distributions associated with distinct hashtags."

We obtain the average size of the fluctuations at the nodes from the behavior of the underlying modes of the network. We then obtain the scaling behavior of the extreme fluctuations with system size, as well as the distribution of the extremes on complex networks, and compare them to those on regular one-dimensional lattices. For large complex networks, when the delay is not too close to the critical one, fluctuations at the nodes effectively decouple, and the limit distributions converge to the Fisher-Tippett-Gumbel density. In contrast, fluctuations in low-dimensional spatial graphs are strongly correlated, and the limit distribution of the extremes is the Airy density."

In this paper, we consider a wireless network where the application flows consist of video traffic. From a user perspective, reducing the level of video distortion is critical. We ask the question Should the routing policies change if the end-to-end video distortion is to be minimized? Popular link-quality-based routing metrics (such as ETX) do not account for dependence (in terms of congestion) across the links of a path; as a result, they can cause video flows to converge onto a few paths and, thus, cause high video distortion. To account for the evolution of the video frame loss process, we construct an analytical framework to, first, understand and, second, assess the impact of the wireless network on video distortion. The framework allows us to formulate a routing policy for minimizing distortion, based on which we design a protocol for routing video traffic. We find via simulations and testbed experiments that our protocol is efficient in reducing video distortion and minimizing the user experience degradation."

        "abstract": "How existing technologies and ideas are recombined into new innovations remains an important question, particularly as the store of prior technology, art, and work expands at an increasing rate.  Yet, methodologies for identifying effective recombinations remain a nascent area of research. This paper extends our previous work, which developed a network methodology for assessing a scientific papers recombinations of prior work.  The methodology uses information from the entire co-citation network of all papers recorded in the Web of Science to identify combinations of prior work that are conventional or atypical and then identifies the virtuous mix of conventional and atypical pairings associated with high impact work (Uzzi et al., 2013).  Here, we summarize our prior method and findings, present new findings, and a case study application to the field of management science.  First, we show that despite an ever-increasing frontier of possible new combinations of prior work, atypical combinations of prior work are becoming increasingly rare with time, while the distribution of conventional pairings is increasing with time.  Second, we show that with time the atypical pairings found in hit papers have a relatively stable mean rate at which they become conventional pairing.  Nevertheless, the variance around the mean is growing significantly, which indicates that there is a greater tendency over time for novel pairings either to be virtually never used again or to become conventional pairings."

        "abstract": "Traded corporations are required by law to have a majority of outside directors on\ntheir board. This requirement allows the existence of directors who sit on the board of\ntwo or more corporations at the same time, generating what is commonly known as\ninterlocking directorates. While research has shown that networks of interlocking\ndirectorates facilitate the transmission of information between corporations, little is\nknown about the extent to which such interlocking networks can explain the\nfluctuations of stock price returns. Yet, this is a special concern since the risk of\namplifying stock fluctuations is latent. To answer this question, here we analyze the\nboard composition, traders perception, and stock performance of more than 1,500\nUS traded corporations from 2007-2011. First, we find that the fewer degrees of\nseparation between two corporations in the interlocking network, the stronger the\ntemporal correlation between their stock price returns. Second, we find that the\ncentrality of traded corporations in the interlocking network correlates with the\nfrequency at which financial traders talk about such corporations, and this frequency\nis in turn proportional to the corresponding traded volume. Third, we show that the\ncentrality of corporations was negatively associated with their stock performance in\n2008, the year of the big financial crash. These results suggest that the strategic\ndecisions made by interlocking directorates are strongly followed by stock analysts\nand have the potential to correlate and amplify the movement of stock prices during\nfinancial crashes. These results may have relevant implications for scholars, investors,\nand regulators."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we examine whether collective intelligence signals exist in modern complex organizations that could result in better decisions than were actually made had this information been incorporated in the original decisions.  Unlike crowds, organizations are the most pervasive human infrastructure for making consequential decisions.  Moreover, the historical motivation of the design of organizations creates new scientific challenges for understanding collective intelligence.  The fertile conditions associated with collective intelligence revolve around crowds that are made up of diverse decision-makers making independent decisions (Lorenz, Rauhut, Schweitzer, Helbing 2011 PNAS).  By contrast, the scale economics and stable membership of organizations dictate that decision-makers have correlated information and work towards consensual rather than independent decisions.   Indeed, in recent years, the failure of organizations to predict and solve crises (oil well, citizen science, financial markets, disease control (cites)), as well as fundamental changes in communication technology points to the need to, and possibility for, understanding how collective intelligence can operate effectively in non-crowds.

        "abstract": "Crowds offer a new form of efficacious collective decision making, yet knowledge about the mechanisms by which they achieve superior outcomes remains nascent. One mechanism involves the role of networks within crowds. Sociological discussions of markets argue that risky decisions are mitigated by network relations that embed economic transactions in social ties that promote trustworthiness and reciprocity. By contrast, other work suggests that crowds work best with market-like relationships, when individuals in the crowd make independent decisions and possess dissimilar information. To investigate the role of networks within crowds and their performance effects, we examined the complete record of financial lending decisions on Prosper.com, 01/2006-03/2012, the first U.S. crowdfunding platform and a chief gateway to capital for entrepreneurs and general borrowers that continues to disrupt conventional financial lending structures infusing more than $5.1 billion into the market in 2013. Our study reveals how reciprocity, recurring borrower-lender dyads, and persistent co-lending underpin the dynamics of network lending. Further, we show how network ties influence the evolution of the lending behavior. We find that in the early stage of fundraising, network relations provide larger proportions of loans, typically lending four times more per bid than strangers. They also respond to loan requests on average 59.5% sooner than strangers. The size of the first loan and the time to lending also tend to prompt lending by strangers, suggesting that network relations might move the market, a finding that persists even as fewer lenders dominate more of the market for loans on Proper. Finally, network relations are associated with greater engagement, in specific 50% friend involvement in case the first loan was underwritten by a friend rather than a stranger."

Here we develop a self-consistent theory of dynamical perturbations in complex systems, allowing us to systematically separate the contribution of the network topology and dynamics. The formalism covers a broad range of steady-state dynamical processes and offers testable predictions regarding the systems response to perturbations and the development of correlations. It predicts several distinct universality classes whose characteristics can be derived directly from the continuum equation governing the systems dynamics and which are validated on several canonical network-based dynamical systems, from biochemical dynamics to epidemic spreading. Finally, we collect experimental data pertaining to social and biological systems, demonstrating that we can accurately uncover their universality class even in the absence of an appropriate continuum theory that governs the systems dynamics."

The considered description offers a general and unified framework, in which previously proposed mobility models like the gravity model, the intervening opportunities model, and the recently introduced radiation model are naturally resulting as special cases. A new form of radiation model is derived and its validity is investigated using observational data offered by commuting trips obtained from the United States census data set, and the mobility fluxes extracted from mobile phone data collected in a western European country. The new modeling paradigm offered by this description suggests that the complex topological features observed in large mobility and transportation networks may be the result of a simple stochastic process taking place on an inhomogeneous landscape."

        "abstract": "Predictions of physical and functional links between cellular components are often based on correlations between experimental measurements, such as gene expression. However, correlations are affected by both direct and indirect paths, confounding our ability to identify true pairwise interactions. Here we exploit the fundamental properties of dynamical correlations in networks to develop a method to silence indirect effects. The method receives as input the observed correlations between node pairs and uses a matrix transformation to turn the correlation matrix into a highly discriminative silenced matrix, which enhances only the terms associated with direct causal links. Against empirical data for Escherichia coli regulatory interactions, the method enhanced the discriminative power of the correlations by twofold, yielding >50% predictive improvement over traditional correlation measures and 6% over mutual information. Overall this silencing method will help translate the abundant correlation data into insights about a system's interactions, with applications ranging from link prediction to inferring the dynamical mechanisms governing biological networks."

Given a large edge-labeled network, e.g., a time-evolving network, how can we find interesting patterns? We propose Com 2 , a novel, fast and incremental tensor analysis approach which can discover communities appearing over subsets of the labels. The method is (a) scalable, being linear on the input size, (b) general, (c) needs no user-defined parameters and (d) effective, returning results that agree with intuition. We apply our method to real datasets, including a phone call network, a computer-traffic network and a flight information network. The phone call network consists of 4 million mobile users, with 51 million edges (phone calls), over 14 days, while the flights dataset consists of 7733 airports and 5995 airline companies flying 67,663 different routes. We show that Com 2  spots intuitive patterns regarding edge labels that carry temporal or other discrete information. Our findings include large star-like patterns, near-bipartite cores, as well as tiny groups (five users), calling each other hundreds of times within a few days. We also show that we are able to automatically identify competing airline companies."

Several overlapping extensions of modularity were proposed to measure the quality of overlapping community structure. However, all these extensions differ just in the way they define the belonging coefficients and belonging functions. Yet, there is lack of systematic comparison of different extensions. To fill this gap, we overview overlapping extensions of modularity and generalize them with a uniform definition combining belonging coefficients and belonging functions to select the best. In addition, we extend localized modularity, modularity density, and eight local community quality metrics to enable their usages for overlapping communities. The experimental results on a large number of real networks and synthetic networks using overlapping extensions of modularity, overlapping modularity density, and local metrics show that the best results are obtained when the product of the belonging coefficients of two nodes is used as the belonging function. Moreover, the results give a guidance to researchers on which metrics to adopt when measuring the quality of overlapping community structure."

In particular, we identify the conditions under which sharing side information between the encoder and the decoder may be superior or inferior to having two-sided, i.e., correlated but not\nidentical, side information. As a special case, we characterize the optimal rate-distortion function for a direct binary source with two-sided information by proposing an achievable scheme and proving a converse. This example suggests a hierarchy on the impact of side information, in that the performance is mainly determined by how well the decoder learns about the source and then by how well the encoder learns about the decoder's observation."

        "abstract": "Physical events in the real world are known to trigger reactions and then discussions in online social media.  Mining these reactions through online social sensors offers a fast and low cost way to understand what is happening in the physical world. In some cases, however, further study of the affected populations emotional state can improve this understanding. In our study we analyzed how car commuters react on Twitter while stuck in heavy traffic. We discovered that the online social footprint does not necessarily follow a strict linear correlation with the volume of a traffic jam. Through our analysis we offer a potential explanation: peoples mood could be an additional factor, apart from traffic severity itself, that leads in fluctuations of the observed reaction in social media. This finding can be important for social sensing applications where external factors, like sentiment, also contribute on how humans react. Ignoring the existence of such factors can lead in reduced quality and accuracy of a regression analysis. We propose a novel traffic-congestion estimation model that utilizes the volume of messages and complaints in online social media, based on when they happen. We show through experimental evaluation that the proposed model can estimate, with higher accuracy, traffic jam severity and compare the results  with several baselines. The model achieves at least 38% improvement of absolute error and more than 45% improvement of relative error, when compared with a baseline that assumes linear correlation between traffic and social volume. To support our findings we combined data from the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) and Twitter, for a total of 6 months, and focused on a major traffic-heavy freeway in Los Angeles, California."

        "abstract": "Hierarchical graph compression and summarization techniques compute graph models in which successive levels model progressively smaller components of the graph.  Hierarchical techniques typically involve splittling the graph into clusters based on feature similarity.  Our approach is instead related to frequent subgraph discovery algorithms, because it finds recurring instances of subgraphs that have particular connectivity patterns.  Our approach is also different from most subgraph discovery approaches because it avoids characterizing patterns as complex chains of joins, whose hits can be exponentially large.   Our approach is particularly efficient because it is implementable using dynamic programming and/or parallel methods."

        "abstract": "The increasing availability of smartphones, cameras, and wearables with instant data sharing capabilities, and the exploitation of social networks for information broadcast, heralds a future of real-time information overload. With the growing excess of worldwide streaming data, such as images, geotags, text annotations, and sensory measurements, an increasingly common service will become one of data summarization. The objective of such a service will be to obtain a representative sampling of large data streams at a configurable granularity, in real-time, for subsequent consumption by a range of data-centric applications. This paper describes a general-purpose self-summarizing storage service, called SocialTrove, for social sensing applications. The service summarizes data streams from human sources, or sensors in their possession, by hierarchically clustering received information in accordance with an application-specific distance metric. It then serves a sampling of produced clusters at a configurable granularity in response to application queries. While SocialTrove is a general service, we illustrate its functionality and evaluate it in the specific context of workloads collected from Twitter. Results show that SocialTrove supports a high query throughput, while maintaining a low access latency to the produced real-time application-specific data summaries. As a specific application case-study, we implement a fact-finding service on top of SocialTrove.\n\n"

This paper improves on the above results by formulating a {\\\\em joint\\\\/} localization problem of events and sources, leveraging the fact that sources on social networks often have a location affinity: They tend to comment more on events in their locations of interest. While social networks, such as Twitter, do not offer source location information for the majority of sources, we show that our algorithms for jointly inferring source and event location significantly improve localization quality by mutually enhancing location estimation of both events and sources. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm both in simulation and using Twitter data about current events.

        "abstract": "We develop data retrieval algorithms for crowdsensing applications that reduce the underlying network bandwidth consumption or any additive cost metric by exploiting logical dependencies among data items, while maintaining the level of service to the client applications. Crowdsensing applications refer to those where local measurements are performed by humans or devices in their possession for subsequent aggregation and sharing purposes. In this paper, we focus on resource limited crowdsensing, such as disaster response and recovery scenarios. The key challenge in those scenarios is to cope with resource constraints. Unlike the traditional application design, where measurements are sent to a central aggregator, in resource limited scenarios, data will typically reside at the source until requested to prevent needless transmission. Many applications exhibit dependencies among data items. For example, parts of a city might tend to get ooded together because of a correlated low elevation, and some roads might become useless for evacuation if a bridge they lead to fails. Such dependencies can be encoded as logic expressions that obviate retrieval of some data items based\non values of others. Our algorithm takes logical data dependencies into consideration such that application queries are answered at\nthe central aggregation node, while network bandwidth usage is minimized. The algorithms consider multiple concurrent queries\nand accommodate retrieval latency constraints. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms several baselines by\nsignicant margins, maintaining the level of service perceived by applications in the presence of resource-constraints."

        "abstract": "The proliferation of mobile sensing and communication devices in the possession of the average individual generated much recent interest in social sensing applications. Significant advances were made on the problem of uncovering ground truth from observations made by participants of unknown reliability. The problem, also called fact-finding commonly arises in applications where unvetted individuals may opt in to report phenomena of interest. For example, reliability of individuals might be unknown when they can join a participatory sensing campaign simply by downloading a smartphone app. This paper extends past social sensing literature by offering a scalable approach for exploiting dependencies between observed variables to increase fact-finding accuracy. Prior work assumed that reported facts are independent, or incurred exponential complexity when dependencies were present. In contrast, this paper presents the first scalable approach for accommodating dependency graphs between observed states. The approach is tested using real-life data collected in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy on availability of gas, food, and medical supplies, as well as extensive simulations.  Evaluation shows that combining expected correlation graphs (of outages) with reported observations of unknown reliability, results in a much more reliable reconstruction of ground truth from the noisy social sensing data. We also show that correlation graphs can help test hypotheses regarding underlying causes, when different hypotheses are ssociated with different correlation patterns. For example, an observed outage profile can be attributed to a supplier outage or to excessive local demand. The two differ in expected correlations in observed outages, enabling joint identification of both the actual outages and their underlying causes.\n"

In this paper, we concern ourselves with the challenge of event localization from Twitter feeds. We explore the quality of information that can be derived either directly or indirectly from microblog entries regarding locations of ongoing events. Contrary to prior work that used Twitter to map regions of large-footprint events, or derived coarse-grained location information, in this paper, we are interested in point-events, such as building fires or car accidents, and aim to pin-point them down to a street address. An algorithm is presented that identifies distinct event signatures in the blogosphere, clusters microblogs based on events they describe, and analyzes the resulting clusters for fine-grained location indicators. An exact event location is then derived by fusing these indicators. To evaluate the quality of derived location information, we use road-traffic-related Twitter feeds from 3 major cities in California and compare automatic event localization within our service to manually obtained ground truth data. Results show a great correspondence between our automatically determined locations and ground-truth. "

The mean-field analysis shows that there exists a critical value of the external field pc such that for a weak external field (p<pc), the system exhibits a metastable fixed point and a saddle point in addition to a stable fixed point. However, if the strength of the external field is sufficiently large (p>pc), there is only one (stable) fixed point which corresponds to an all-centrist consensus state (absorbing state). In the weak-field regime, the convergence time to the absorbing state is evaluated using the quasi-stationary distribution and is found to be in agreement with the results obtained by numerical simulations."

However, incompleteness and inaccuracy of network data collection methods often cause the communities based on the collected datasets to be different from the ground truth. In this paper, we aim to recover or improve the network community structure using scores provided by different link prediction techniques to replace a fraction of low ranking existing links with top ranked predicted links. Experimental results show that applying our approach to different networks can significantly refine community structure.We also show that predictions of edge additions and persistence are confirmed by the future states of evolving social networks. Another important finding is that not every metric performs equally well on all networks. We observe that performance of link prediction ranking is correlated with certain network properties, such as the network size or average node degree."

        "abstract": "Graph regularization-based methods have achieved great success for network classification by making the label-link consistency assumption, i.e., if two nodes are linked together, they are likely to belong to the same class. However, in a real-world network, there exist links that connect nodes of different classes. These inconsistent links raise a big challenge for graph regularization and deteriorate the classification performance significantly. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm, namely Consistent Graph Learning, which is robust to the inconsistent links of a network. In particular, given a network and a small number of labeled nodes, we aim at learning a consistent network with more consistent and fewer inconsistent links than the original network. Since the link information of a network is naturally represented by a set of relation matrices, the learning of a consistent network is reduced to learning consistent relation matrices under some constraints. More specifically, we achieve it by joint graph regularization on the nuclear norm minimization of consistent relation matrices together with L1-norm minimization on the difference matrices between the original relation matrices and the learned consistent ones subject to certain constraints. Experiments on both homogeneous and heterogeneous network datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

        "abstract": "Random walk with restart (RWR) is widely recognized as one of the most important node proximity measures for graphs, as it captures the holistic graph structure and is robust to noise in the graph. In this paper, we study a novel query based on the RWR measure, called the inbound top-k (Ink) query. Given a query node q and a number k, the Ink query aims at retrieving k nodes in the graph that have the largest weighted RWR scores to q. Ink queries can be highly useful for various applications such as traffic scheduling, disease treatment, and targeted advertising. Nevertheless, none of the existing RWR computation techniques can process the Ink query efficiently in large graphs. We propose two algorithms, namely SQUEEZE and RIPPLE, both of which can accurately answer the Ink query in a fast and incremental manner. To identify the top-k nodes, SQUEEZE iteratively performs matrix-vector multiplication and estimates the lower and upper bounds for all the nodes in the graph. RIPPLE employs a more aggressive strategy by only estimating the RWR scores for the nodes falling in the vicinity of q, the nodes outside the vicinity do not need to be evaluated because their RWR scores are propagated from the boundary of the vicinity and thus upper bounded. RIPPLE incrementally expands the vicinity until the top-k result set can be obtained. Our extensive experiments on real-life graph data sets show that Ink queries can retrieve interesting results, and the proposed algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art method."

        "abstract": "Entity recognition is an important but challenging research problem. In reality, many text collections are from specific, dynamic, or emerging domains, which poses significant new challenges for entity recognition with increase in name ambiguity and context sparsity, requiring entity detection without domain restriction.  In this paper, we investigate entity recognition (ER) with distant-supervision and propose a novel relation phrase-based ER framework, called ClusType, that runs data-driven phrase mining to generate entity mention candidates and relation phrases, and enforces the principle that relation phrases should be softly clustered when propagating type information between their argument entities. Then we predict the type of each entity mention based on the type signatures of its co-occurring relation phrases and the type indicators of its surface name, as computed over the corpus. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem for two tasks, type propagation with relation phrases and multi-view relation phrase clustering.  Our experiments on multiple genres---news, Yelp reviews and tweets---demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ClusType, with an average of 37% improvement in F1 score over the best compared method."

        "abstract": "When integrating information from multiple sources, it is common to encounter conflicting answers to the same question. Truth discovery is to infer the most accurate and complete integrated answers from conflicting sources. In some cases, there exist questions for which the true answers are excluded from the candidate answers provided by all sources. Without any prior knowledge, these questions, named no-truth questions, are difficult to be distinguished from the questions that have true answers, named has-truth questions. In particular, these no-truth questions degrade the precision of the answer integration system. We address such a challenge by introducing source quality, which is made up of three fine-grained measures: silent rate, false spoken rate and true spoken rate. By incorporating these three measures, we propose a probabilistic graphical model, which simultaneously infers truth as well as source quality without any a priori training involving ground truth answers. Moreover, since inferring this graphical model requires parameter tuning of the prior of truth, we propose an initialization scheme based upon a quantity named truth existence score, which synthesizes two indicators, namely, participation rate and consistency rate. Compared with existing methods, our method can effectively filter out no-truth questions, which results in more accurate source quality estimation. Consequently, our method provides more accurate and complete answers to both has-truth and no-truth questions. Experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate the notable advantage of our method over existing state-of-the-art truth discovery methods."

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the wide proliferation of geo-sensory applications wherein a bundle of sensors are deployed at different locations to cooperatively monitor the target condition. Given massive geo-sensory data, we study the problem of mining spatial co-evolving patterns (SCPs), i.e., groups of sensors that are spatially correlated and co-evolve frequently in their readings. SCP mining is of great importance to various real-world applications, yet it is challenging because (1) the truly interesting evolutions are often flooded by numerous trivial fluctuations in the geo-sensory time series; and (2) the pattern search space is extremely large due to the spatiotemporal combinatorial nature of SCP. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method called Assember. In the first stage, Assember filters trivial fluctuations using wavelet transform and detects frequent evolutions for individual sensors via a segment-and-group approach. In the second stage, Assember generates SCPs by assembling the frequent evolutions of individual sensors.  Leveraging the spatial constraint, it conceptually organizes all the SCPs into a novel structure called the SCP search tree, which facilitates the effective pruning of the search space to generate SCPs efficiently. Our experiments on both real and synthetic data sets show that Assember is effective, efficient, and scalable."

        "abstract": "In crowdsourced data aggregation task, there exist conflicts in the answers provided by large numbers of sources on the same set of questions. The most important challenge for this task is to esti- mate source reliability and select answers that are provided by high- quality sources. Existing work solves this problem by simultane- ously estimating sources reliability and inferring questions true answers (i.e., the truths). However, these methods assume that a source has the same reliability degree on all the questions, but ig- nore the fact that sources reliability may vary significantly among different topics. To capture various expertise levels on different topics, we propose FaitCrowd, a fine grained truth discovery model for the task of aggregating conflicting data collected from multiple users/sources. FaitCrowd jointly models the process of generating question content and sources provided answers in a probabilistic model to estimate both topical expertise and true answers simulta- neously. This leads to a more precise estimation of source reliabil- ity. Therefore, FaitCrowd demonstrates better ability to obtain true answers for the questions compared with existing approaches. Ex- perimental results on two real-world datasets show that FaitCrowd can significantly reduce the error rate of aggregation compared with the state-of-the-art multi-source aggregation approaches due to its ability of learning topical expertise from question content and col- lected answers."

This study proposes to give users freedom to construct topical hierarchies via interactive operations such as expanding a branch and merging several branches. Existing hierarchical topic modeling techniques are inadequate for this purpose because (1) they cannot consistently preserve the topics when the hierarchy structure is modified; and (2) the slow inference prevents swift response to user requests. In this study, we propose a novel method, called STROD, that allows efficient and consistent modification of topic hierarchies, based on a recursive generative model and a scalable tensor decomposition inference algorithm with theoretical performance guarantee. Empirical evaluation shows that STROD reduces the runtime of construction by several orders of magnitude, while generating consistent and quality hierarchies."

        "abstract": "In the era of big data, information regarding the same objects can be collected from increasingly more sources. Unfortunately, there usually exist conflicts among the information coming from different sources. To tackle this challenge, truth discovery, i.e., to integrate multi-source noisy information by estimating the reliability of each source, has emerged as a hot topic. In many real world applications, however, the information may come sequentially, and as a consequence, the truth of objects as well as the reliability of sources may be dynamically evolving. Existing truth discovery methods, unfortunately, cannot handle such scenarios. To address this problem, we investigate the temporal relations among both object truths and source reliability, and propose an incremental truth discovery framework that can dynamically update object truths and source weights upon the arrival of new data. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that the proposed method is guaranteed to converge at a fast rate. The experiments on three real world applications and a set of synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art truth discovery methods."

        "abstract": "With the increasing use of GPS-enabled mobile phones, geotagging, which refers to adding GPS information to media such as micro-blogging messages or photos, has seen a surge in popularity recently. This enables us to not only browse information based on locations, but also discover patterns in the location-based behaviors of users. Many techniques have been developed to find the patterns of peoples movements using GPS data, but latent topics in text messages posted with local contexts have not been utilized effectively. \n\nIn this paper, we present a latent topic-based clustering algorithm to discover patterns in the trajectories of geo-tagged text messages. We propose a novel probabilistic model to capture the semantic regions where people post messages with a coherent topic as well as the patterns of movement between the semantic regions. Based on the model, we develop an efficient inference algorithm to calculate model parameters. By exploiting the estimated model, we next devise a clustering algorithm to find the significant movement patterns that appear frequently in data. Our experiments on real-life data sets show that the proposed algorithm finds diverse and interesting trajectory patterns and identifies the semantic regions in a finer granularity than the traditional geographical clustering methods."

        "abstract": "One of the key obstacles in making learning protocols realistic in applications is the need to supervise them, a costly process that often requires hiring domain experts. We consider the framework to use the world knowledge as indirect supervision. World knowledge is general-purpose knowledge, which is not designed for any specific domain. Then the key challenges are how to adapt the world knowledge to domains and how to represent it for learning. In this paper, we provide an example of using world knowledge for domain dependent document clustering. We provide three ways to specify the world knowledge to domains by resolving the ambiguity of the entities and their types, and represent the data with world knowledge as a heterogeneous information network. Then we propose a clustering algorithm that can cluster multiple types and incorporate the sub-type information as constraints. In the experiments, we use two existing knowledge bases as our sources of world knowledge. One is Freebase, which is collaboratively collected knowledge about entities and their organizations. The other is YAGO2, a knowledge base automatically extracted from Wikipedia and maps knowledge to the linguistic knowledge base, WordNet. Experimental results on two text benchmark datasets (20newsgroups and RCV1) show that incorporating world knowledge as indirect supervision can significantly outperform the state-of-theart clustering algorithms as well as clustering algorithms enhanced with world knowledge features."

This paper formulates relation clustering as a constrained tripartite graph clustering problem, presents an efficient clustering algorithm and exhibits the advantage of the constrained framework.

Transforming unstructured text into structured units (e.g., semantically meaningful phrases) will substantially reduce semantic ambiguity and enhance the power and efficiency at manipulating such data using database technology. Thus mining quality phrases is a critical research problem in the field of databases. In this paper, we propose a new framework that extracts quality phrases from text corpora integrated with phrasal segmentation. The framework requires only limited training but the quality of phrases so generated is close to human judgment. Moreover, the method is scalable: both computation time and required space grow linearly as corpus size increases. Our experiments on large text corpora demonstrate the quality and efficiency of the new method."

        "abstract": "Entity Extraction is a process of identifying meaningful entities from text documents. In enterprises, extracting entities improves enterprise efficiency by facilitating numerous applications, including search, recommendation, etc. However, the problem is particularly challenging on enterprise domains due to several reasons. First, the lack of redundancy of enterprise entities makes previous web-based systems like NELL and OpenIE not effective, since using only high-precision/low-recall patterns like those systems would miss the majority of sparse enterprise entities, while using more low-precision patterns in sparse setting also introduces noise drastically. Second, semantic drift is common in enterprises (Blue refers to Windows Blue), such that public signals from the web cannot be directly applied on entities. Moreover, many internal entities never appear on the web. Sparse internal signals are the only source for discovering them. To address these challenges, we propose an end-toend framework for extracting entities in enterprises, taking the input of enterprise corpus and limited seeds to generate a high-quality entity collection as output. We introduce the novel concept of Semantic Pattern Graph to leverage public signals to understand the underlying semantics of lexical patterns, reinforce pattern evaluation using mined semantics, and yield more accurate and complete entities. Experiments on Microsoft enterprise data show the effectiveness of our approach."

        "abstract": "Percolation transitions in networks, describing the formation of a macroscopic component, are typically considered to be robust continuous transitions in random percolation. Yet, a class of models with various rules of connecting edges were recently devised which can lead to discontinuous transitions at percolation threshold. Here we study the BohmanFriezeWormald process on scale-free networks constructed via a modified configuration model. We show via numerical simulation that multiple discontinuous transitions appear in the thermodynamic limit for the degree distribution exponent   [2, c) with c  (2.3,2.4). For   (c,5] this model undergoes a unique discontinuous transition in the thermodynamic limit, but for any finite system a second discontinuous transition occasionally appears at some point above percolation threshold due to the aggregation of two existing giant components. For all values of the exponent   [2, 5] we observe a pronounced right-hump in the evolution of component size distribution providing further evidence that the percolation transition is discontinuous at percolation threshold.\n"

        "abstract": "The emergence of large-scale connectivity on an underlying network or lattice, the so-called percolation transition, has a profound impact on the systems macroscopic behaviours. There is thus great interest in controlling the location of the percolation transition to either enhance or delay its onset and, more generally, in understanding the consequences of such control interventions. Here we review explosive percolation, the sudden emergence of large-scale connectivity that results from repeated, small interventions designed to delay the percolation transition. These transitions exhibit drastic, unanticipated and exciting consequences that make explosive percolation an emerging paradigm for modelling real-world systems ranging from social networks to nanotubes."

For random graphs and\npower-law graphs, the scaling exponent is at or near 2 (quadratic\namplification).

(2) Can we separate these cues from the content and quantify their influence on credibility perception?, and (3) To what extent is such a quantification portable across different microblogging platforms?  To answer the third question, we study two popular microblogs, Reddit and Twitter. Key results include that significant effects of individual factors can be isolated, are portable, and that links, profile pictures and image content are the strongest influencing factors in credibility assessment.

This novel interface introduces filters by communities, and network structure, as well as ranking of tweets. The interface aims to improving content discovery, while maintaining content relevance and sense of user control. Participants in the US and the UK interacted with the interface in semi-structured interviews. In two iterations of the same study (n=4, n=8), we found that the interface increased user sense of control, but also identifies suggestions by users for improvements. For example, participants asked for an active selection of communities, and a more fine-grained functionality for saving individual `favorite' users. Users also highlighted unanticipated uses of the interface such as iteratively discovering new communities to follow, and organizing events. Informed by these studies, we propose improvements and a mock-up for an interface to be used for future larger scale experiments for exploring microblog content."

        "abstract": "This study tested a model of the impact of entrainment of individual and team group processes on the development of shared mental models in multiteam systems (MTS) and ultimately on MTS effectiveness.  The study sampled 75 MTSs, each composed of two three-person teams, engaged in a computer simulated convoy protection task.  Sequence analysis methods were used to identify short-cycle communication and action sequences from activity logs, which served as the basic units of analysis.  Entrainment of within-team and between-team sequences was calculated using a phase-lock statistic that indicated the degree to which the frequencies of sequences were synchronized over time among members of the teams.  Results indicated that, as hypothesized, a combination of high levels of between-team entrainment and low levels of within-team entrainment was positively related to the development of a shared mental model in the MTS.  Moreover, the degree of development of a shared mental model had a positive causal effect on two outcome variables, individual team performance and  MTS performance.  The methodology used in the study offers a new approach for the study of group processes that tracks individual interdependencies that lead to emergent team properties."

        "abstract": "Military forces operate in a complex environment of interconnected social, information, and communication networks. Thus, research to advance military capabilities requires an infrastructure for real-time modeling of mobile network systems to provide a controlled, repeatable emulation and simulation environment for network science. Traditionally, network experimentation has focused on one network genre at a time; for example, command and control experiments might examine patterns of information flow between people while hardware networking experiments might compare alternative routing algorithms. Yet, in a military mission, human networks and hardware networks interact dynamically, with cross-network cascades or compensation impacting overall mission performance. Thus, there is a need for basic and applied experimental study of these multi-genre network phenomena, and of any universal invariants and common characteristics across all types of networks.\n\nThe challenges for such multi-genre network experimentation include different levels of representation and model fidelity, as well as mismatched time scales for network interactions and evolution. To address these challenges and to support multi-genre network experiments, we have created a multi-genre network experiment framework for integration and interoperability of components to simulate or emulate various aspects within a tactical level information gathering and mission execution scenario. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, we have used it to link two agent-based organizational behavior simulations to a communications network emulator. In our baseline experiments, we use these integrated network models to study the impact of imperfect communications networks on mission performance, and the impact of goal-driven, reactive group behaviors on tactical network performance. Our initial scenarios and components support the manipulation of network parameters such as network bandwidth, information noise, team hierarchy, information sharing policies, and individual cognitive/behavioral tendencies. The framework will also support future work with adaptive networks, using automated Quality of Information (QoI) transformations on data, information-aware network components, and network-aware algorithms.\n\nThis paper presents the motivation for multi-genre network science experimentation and outlines necessary experimentation functionalities. It describes the interface and framework which enables multi-genre network experimentation with social/cognitive, information and communication layers. Specifically, we detail how the framework allows interoperability of network genre specific tools using an Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc Network Emulator (EMANE) module called a Shim. Finally, we describe the design and results of baseline experiments on interactions between social/cognitive and communications networks using this framework."

Mission success depends, to a significant degree, upon the ability to effectively establish command and control (C2) utilizing these collective of networks. Understanding the inter-dependencies of these co-evolving networks is important, because their behaviors can lead to failure cascades and vulnerabilities on the one hand or contribute to robustness on the other hand. \nWe examine cross-genre network interactions holistically utilizing a Company Intelligence Support Team (CoIST) inspired scenario.  Among the controllable variable that need to be considered are:  group organization, policies regarding information propagation, addition of smart sensors and data transformation; to the topology and performance characteristics of the underlying communications network, and finally the quality of information. By modeling and simulating key interdependencies and interactions between and among these networks, we can study tipping points and observe cascades that impact individual genre and composite network performance. As a result of these experiments with abstracted a CoIST scenario and an instantiated composite system simulating social/cognitive, information, and communications networks, we can better understand how network design can help meet operational objectives, improve shared situation awareness, and dynamically adapt to the unfolding knowledge terrain."

        "abstract": "The microscopic principles organizing dynamic units in complex networksfrom proteins to power generatorscan be understood in terms of network motifs: small interconnection patterns that appear much more frequently in real networks than expected in random networks. When considered as small subgraphs isolated from a large network, these motifs are more robust to parameter variations, easier to synchronize than other possible subgraphs, and can provide specific functionalities. But one can isolate these subgraphs only by assuming, for example, a significant separation of timescales, and the origin of network motifs and their functionalities when embedded in larger networks remain unclear. Here we show that most motifs emerge from interconnection patterns that best exploit the intrinsic stability characteristics at different scales of interconnection, from simple nodes to whole modules. This functionality suggests an efficient mechanism to stably build complex systems by recursively interconnecting nodes and modules as motifs. We present direct evidence of this mechanism in several biological networks."

But the observational uncertainty induced by measurement noise and the energy required for control continue to be significant challenges in practical applications. Here we show that the variability of control energy and observational uncertainty for different directions of the state space depend strongly on the number of driver nodes. In particular, we find that if all nodes are directly driven, control is energetically feasible, as the maximum energy increases sublinearly with the system size. If, however, we aim to control a system through a single node, control in some directions is energetically prohibitive, increasing exponentially with the system size. For the cases in between, the maximum energy decays exponentially when the number of driver nodes increases. We validate our findings in several model and real networks, arriving at a series of fundamental laws to describe the control energy that together deepen our understanding of complex systems."

        "abstract": "AbstractAn important problem in the study of sensor networks is how to select a set of sensors that maximizes coverage of other sensors. Given pairwise coverage values, three commonly found functions give some estimate of the aggregate coverage possible by a set of sensors: maximum coverage by any selected sensor (MAX), total coverage by all selected sensors (SUM), and the probability of correct prediction by at least one sensor (PROB). MAX and SUM are two extremes of possible coverage, while PROB, based on an independence assumption, is in the middle. This paper addresses the following question: what guarantees can be made of coverage that is evaluated by an unknown sub-modular function of coverage when sensors are selected according to MAX, SUM, or PROB? We prove that the guarantees are very bad: In the worst case, coverage differs by a factor of sqrt(n), where n is the number of sensors. We show in simulations on synthetic and real data that the differences can be quite high as well. We show how to potentially address this problem using a hybrid of the coverage functions."

        "abstract": "We study the problem of link prediction in coupled networks, where we have the structure information of one (source) network and the interactions between this network and another (target) network. The goal is to predict the missing links in the target network. The problem is extremely challenging as we do not have any information of the target network. Moreover, the source and target networks are usually heterogeneous and have different types of nodes and links. How to utilize the structure information in the source network for predicting links in the target network? How to lever- age the heterogeneous interactions between the two networks for the prediction task?\n\nWe propose a unified framework, CoupledLP, to solve the problem. Given two coupled networks, we first leverage atomic propagation rules to automatically construct implicit links in the target network for addressing the challenge of target network incomplete- ness, and then propose a Coupled Factor Graph Model to incorporate the meta-paths extracted from the coupled part of the two net- works for transferring heterogeneous knowledge. We evaluate the proposed framework on two different genres of datasets: disease- gene (DG) and mobile social networks. In the DG networks, we aim to use the disease network to predict the associations between genes. In the mobile networks, we aim to use the mobile communication network of one mobile operator to infer the network structure of its competitors. On both datasets, the proposed CoupledLP framework outperforms several alternative methods. The proposed problem of coupled link prediction and the corresponding frame- work demonstrate both the scientific and business applications in biology and social networks.\n"

        "abstract": "Collaboration is an integral element of the scien- tific process that often leads to findings with significant impact. While extensive efforts have been devoted to quantifying and predicting research impact, the question of how collaborative behavior influences scientific impact remains unaddressed. In this work, we study the interplay between scientists collaboration signatures and their scientific impact. As the basis of our study, we employ an ArnetMiner dataset with more than 1.7 million authors and 2 million papers spanning over 60 years. We formally define a scientists collaboration signature as the distribution of collaboration strengths with each collaborator in his or her academic ego network, which is quantified by four measures: sociability, dependence, diversity, and self-collaboration. We then demonstrate that the collaboration signature allows us to effectively distinguish between researchers with dissimilar levels of scientific impact. We also discover that, even from the early stages of ones researcher career, a scientists collaboration signature can help to reveal his or her future scientific impact. Finally, we find that as a representative group of outstanding computer scientists, Turing Award winners collectively produce distinctive collaboration signatures throughout the entirety of their careers. Our conclusions on the relationship between collaboration signatures and scientific impact give rise to important implications for researchers who wish to expand their scientific impact and more effectively stand on the shoulders of collaborators.\n"

        "abstract": "The pervasiveness and availability of mobile phone data offer the opportunity of discovering usable knowledge about crowd behavior in urban environments. Cities can leverage such knowledge to provide better services (e.g., public transport planning, optimized resource allocation) and safer environment. Call Detail Record (CDR) data represents a practical data source to detect and monitor unusual events considering the high level of mobile phone penetration, compared with GPS equipped and open devices. In this paper, we propose a methodology that is able to detect unusual events from CDR data, which typically has low accuracy in terms of space and time resolution. Moreover, we introduce a concept of unusual event that involves a large amount of people who expose an unusual mobility behavior. Our careful consideration of the issues that come from coarse-grained CDR data ultimately leads to a completely general framework that can detect unusual crowd events from CDR data effectively and efficiently. Through extensive experiments on real-world CDR data for a large city in Africa, we demonstrate that our method can detect unusual events with 16% higher recall and over 10 higher precision, compared to state-of-the-art methods. We implement a visual analytics prototype system to help end users analyze detected unusual crowd events to best suit different application scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the detection of unusual events from CDR data with considerations of its temporal and spatial sparseness and distinction between user unusual activities and daily routines.\n"

        "abstract": "Interactions in dynamic networks often transcend the dyadic barrier and emerge as subgraphs. The evolution of these subgraphs cannot be completely predicted using a pairwise link prediction analysis. We propose a novel solution to the problemPrediction of Recurrent Subgraphs (PReSub) which treats subgraphs as individual entities in their own right. PReSub predicts re-occurring subgraphs using the networks vector space embedding and a set of early warning subgraphs which act as global and local descriptors of the subgraphs behavior. PReSub can be used as an out-of-the-box pipeline method with user-provided subgraphs or even to discover interesting subgraphs in an unsupervised manner. It can handle missing network information and is parallelizable. We show that PReSub outperforms traditional pairwise link prediction for a variety of evolving network datasets. The goal of this framework is to improve our understanding of subgraphs and provide an alternative representation in order to characterize their behavior.\n"

        "abstract": "The concept of trust and/or trust management has received considerable attention in engineering research communities as trust is perceived as the basis for decision making in many contexts and the motivation for maintaining long term relationships based on cooperation and collaboration. Even if substantial research effort has been dedicated to addressing trust-based mechanisms or trust metrics (or computation) in diverse contexts, prior work has not clearly solved the issue of how to model and quantify trust with sufficient detail and context-based adequateness. The issue of trust quantification has become more complicated as we have the need to derive trust from complex, composite networks that may involve four distinct layers of communication protocols, information exchange, social interactions, and cognitive motivations. In addition, the diverse application domains require different aspects of trust for decision making such as emotional, logical, and relational trust. This survey aims to outline the foundations of trust models for applications in these contexts in terms of the concept of trust, trust assessment, trust constructs, trust scales, trust properties, trust formulation, and applications of trust. We discuss how different components of trust can be mapped to different layers of a complex, composite network and applicability of trust metrics and models, research challenges and future work directions."

This class of networks requires the modification of traditional routing and security protocols, such as TCP/IP or the use of certificate revocation servers, to effectively transmit a message from source to destination in a secure manner. There are multiple trust and routing schemes proposed for use in Delay Tolerant Networks. Here, we show how trust, usually defined in the context of network science, can be utilized for routing in Delay Tolerant Networks in which the fundamental challenge is balancing energy, delivery rate, delivery delay and security. Trust is a cornerstone of our approach to address this challenge. We propose a Trust Based Secure Routing Protocol, in which forwarding decisions are based on nodes trust, expected destination meeting time and the number of already created copies of the message."

The paper begins with an introduction to pragmatics followed by a brief discussion of its relation to semantics. Section II will briefly explain distinctions between near-side and far-side pragmatics. Section III focuses on the scope of pragmatic approaches. While Speech Act Theory plays a domi-nant role in traditional pragmatics, this piece lends a special focus on alternative aspects such as locu-tionary acts and unified theory. The piece concludes with a discussion of contemporary issues in pragmatics, including neo-Gricean pragmatics and the emergence of Relevancy Theory. It is worth noting that the work is not an exhaustive coverage, but an introduction to the tradition. Certain points are omitted, such as cross-linguistic variation (e.g. non-English analysis). Our intent is to provide a range of pragmatic methods and techniques which may be leveraged to address the quality of infor-mation problem."

The Webs role and impact on our daily lives is evident as we connect with friends and family; conduct business transactions; and search for new information resources. Unfortunately, this newfound access to vast amounts of information also results in information overload. As de Moor (2005) noted, increasingly, the problem shifts from making information accessible, to delivering relevant information to the user (p. 2). To help navigate this largely heterogenous information space, search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.) offer users a way to query for resources. Each offers a level of customized search results based on complicated algorithms and machine learning techniques informed by numerous user behavioral and profiling cues. Yet, despite this undoubtedly successful approach, the question of relevance continues to challenge the computing community.  With this paper, we hope to contribute additional points of discussion that explore the realm of context and relevance within the Web-search and information retrieval space. "

        "abstract": "Crowds offer a new form of efficacious collective decision making, yet knowledge about the mechanisms by which they achieve superior outcomes remains nascent. One mechanism involves the role of networks within crowds. Sociological discussions of markets argue that risky decisions are mitigated by network relations that embed economic transactions in social ties that promote trustworthiness and reciprocity. By contrast, other work suggests that crowds work best with market-like relationships, when individuals in the crowd make independent decisions and possess dissimilar information. To investigate the role of networks within crowds and their performance effects, we examined the complete record of financial lending decisions on Prosper.com, 01/2006-03/2012, the first U.S. crowdfunding platform and a chief gateway to capital for entrepreneurs and general borrowers that continues to disrupt conventional financial lending structures infusing more than $5.1 billion into the market in 2013. Our study reveals how reciprocity, recurring borrower-lender dyads, and persistent co-lending underpin the dynamics of network lending. Further, we show how network ties influence the evolution of the lending behavior. We find that in the early stage of fundraising, network relations provide larger proportions of loans, typically lending four times more per bid than strangers. They also respond to loan requests on average 59.5% sooner than strangers. The size of the first loan and the time to lending also tend to prompt lending by strangers, suggesting that network relations might move the market, a finding that persists even as fewer lenders dominate more of the market for loans on Proper. Finally, network relations are associated with greater engagement, in specific 50% friend involvement in case the first loan was underwritten by a friend rather than a stranger."

This paradigm, rooted in Boltzmanns gas theory, has found applications from magnetic phenomena to subcellular processes and epidemic spreading. Yet, each of these advances were the result of decades of meticulous model building and validation, which are impossible to replicate in most complex biological, social or technological systems that lack accurate microscopic models. Here we develop a method to infer the microscopic dynamics of a complex system from observations of its response to external perturbations, allowing us to construct the most general class of nonlinear pairwise dynamics that are guaranteed to recover the observed behaviour. The result, which we test against both numerical and empirical data, is an effective dynamic model that can predict the systems behaviour and provide crucial insights into its inner workings."

        "abstract": "In a cyber war game where a network is fully distributed and characterized by resource constraints and high dynamics, attackers or defenders often face a situation that may require optimal strategies to win the game with minimum effort. Given the system goal states of attackers and defenders, we study what strategies attackers or defenders can take to reach their system goal state (i.e., winning system state) with minimum resource consumption. However, due to the dynamics of a network caused by a node's mobility or failure and/or its resource depletion over time or upon activities, this optimization problem becomes NP-complete. We propose two heuristic strategies in a greedy manner based on a node's two characteristics: resource level and influence based on the concept of $k$-hop reachability. We analyze complexity and optimality of each algorithm compared to optimal solutions for a small-scale static network. Further, we conduct comprehensive experimental study for a large-scale temporal network to investigate best strategies, given different network temporality and density. We demonstrate the performance of each strategy under various attacker/defender strategy scenarios in terms of win probability, resource consumption, and system vulnerability."

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of sampling a node-valued graph. The objective is to infer the values of all nodes from that of a minimum subset of nodes by exploiting correlations in node values. We first introduce the concept of information dominating set (IDS). A subset of nodes in a given graph is an IDS if the values of these nodes are sufficient to infer the values of all nodes. We focus on two fundamental algorithmic problems: (i) how to determine whether a given subset of nodes is an IDS; (ii) how to construct a minimum IDS. Assuming binary node values and the local majority rule for information correlation, we first show that in acyclic graphs, both problems admit linear-complexity solutions by establishing a connection between the IDS problems and the vertex cover problem. We then show that in a general graph, the first problem is co-NP-complete and the second problem is NP-hard. We develop two approaches to solve the IDS problems: one reduces the problems to a hitting set problem based on the concept of essential difference set, the other a gradient-based approach with a tunable parameter that trades off performance with time complexity. The concept of IDS finds applications in opinion sampling such as political polling and market survey, identifying critical nodes in information networks, and inferring epidemics and cascading failures in communication and infrastructure networks."

However, before fully utilizing mobile social\nnetworks as a platform for viral marketing, many challenges have to be addressed. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying\na small number of individuals through whom the information can be diffused to the network as soon as possible, referred to as the\ndiffusion minimization problem. Diffusion minimization under the probabilistic diffusion model can be formulated as an asymmetric k-\ncenter problem which is NP-hard, and the best known approximation algorithm for the asymmetric k-center problem has approximation\nratio of log n and time complexity O(n5). Clearly, the performance and the time complexity of the approximation algorithm are not\nsatisfiable in large-scale mobile social networks. To deal with this problem, we propose a community based algorithm and a distributed\nset-cover algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated by extensive experiments on both synthetic networks\nand a real trace. The results show that the community based algorithm has the best performance in both synthetic networks and the\nreal trace compared to existing algorithms, and the distributed set-cover algorithm outperforms the approximation algorithm in the real\ntrace in terms of diffusion time."

Unlike crowds, organizations are the most pervasive human infrastructure for making consequential decisions.  Moreover, the historical motivation of the design of organizations creates new scientific challenges for understanding collective intelligence.  The fertile conditions associated with collective intelligence revolve around crowds that are made up of diverse decision-makers making independent decisions (Lorenz, Rauhut, Schweitzer, Helbing 2011 PNAS).  By contrast, the scale economics and stable membership of organizations dictate that decision-makers have correlated information and work towards consensual rather than independent decisions.   Indeed, in recent years, the failure of organizations to predict and solve crises (oil well, citizen science, financial markets, disease control (cites)), as well as fundamental changes in communication technology points to the need to, and possibility for, understanding how collective intelligence can operate effectively in non-crowds.

Membership in these communities may overlap when biological components are involved in multiple functions. However, traditional clustering methods detect non-overlapping communities. These detected communities may also be unstable and difficult to replicate, because traditional methods are sensitive to noise and parameter settings. These aspects of traditional clustering methods limit our ability to detect biological communities, and therefore our ability to understand biological functions.\n\nTo address these limitations and detect robust overlapping biological communities, we propose an unorthodox clustering method called SpeakEasy which identifies communities using top-down and bottom-up approaches simultaneously. Specifically, nodes join communities based on their local connections, as well as global information about the network structure. This method can quantify the stability of each community, automatically identify the number of communities, and quickly cluster networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes.\n\nSpeakEasy shows top performance on synthetic clustering benchmarks and accurately identifies meaningful biological communities in a range of datasets, including: gene microarrays, protein interactions, sorted cell populations, electrophysiology and fMRI brain imaging."

Reports from mainstream news agencies and discussions from Twitter complement each other to form a complete picture.  An event can have multiple aspects (sub-events) describing it from multiple angles, each of which attracts opinions/comments posted on Twitter. Mining such reflections  is interesting to both policy makers and ordinary people seeking information. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to mine multi-aspect reflections of news events in Twitter. We propose a novel and efficient dynamic hierarchical entity-aware event discovery model to learn news events and their multiple aspects. The aspects of an event are linked to their reflections in Twitter by a bootstrapped dataless classification scheme, which elegantly handles the challenges of selecting informative tweets under overwhelming noise and bridging the vocabularies of news and tweets. In addition, we demonstrate that our framework naturally generates an informative presentation of each event with entity graphs, time spans, news summaries and tweet highlights to facilitate user digestion."

Annotated samples are used to learn color drift patterns in a non-parametric manner using Random Forest Distance (RFD) function. The color drift patterns are automatically transferred to associate objects across different\nviews using a unified graph matching framework. A Hypergraph representation is used to link related objects for search and reidentification. A diverse hypergraph ranking technique is proposed for person-focussed network summarization.

A good teacher will convey a lot of information, with little effort on the student side. Specifically, given a list of objects (like animals or medical drugs) and their associated properties, what is the best and most intuitive way to convey this information to the student, without the student being overwhelmed? A related, harder problem is: how can we assign a numerical score to each lesson plan (i.e. way of conveying information)? Here, we give a formal definition of this problem of forming learning units and we provide a metric for comparing different approaches based on information theory. We also design an algorithm, GroupNteach, for this problem.\nOur proposed GroupNteach is scalable (near-linear in the dataset size); it is effective, achieving excellent results on real data, both with respect to our proposed metric, but also with respect to encoding length; and it is intuitive, conforming to well-known educational principles, such as grouping related concepts, and ``comparing'' and ``contrasting''. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GroupNteach."

        "abstract": "Suppose you are a teacher, and have to convey a set of object-property pairs (`lions eat meat'; or `aspirin is a blood-thinner'). A good teacher will convey a lot of information, with little effort on the student side. Specifically, given a list of objects (like animals or medical drugs) and their associated properties, what is the best and most intuitive way to convey this information to the student, without the student being overwhelmed? A related, harder problem is: how can we assign a numerical score to each lesson plan (i.e. way of conveying information)? Here, we give a formal definition of this problem of forming learning units and we provide a metric for comparing different approaches based on information theory. We also design a multi-pronged algorithm, Hytra, for this problem.\n\nOur proposed Hytra is scalable (near-linear in the dataset size); it is effective, achieving excellent results on real data, both with respect to our proposed metric, but also with respect to encoding length; and it is intuitive, conforming to well-known educational principles, such as grouping related concepts, and ``comparing'' and ``contrasting''. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Hytra.\n"

        "abstract": "This report outlines and discusses an experimentation vision that identifies and organizes a set of research activities designed to improve our understanding of the composite networks that are critical for successful military operations.\n\nThis report begins with an overview of the experimentation ecosystem required to support the research needed to understand and shape the behaviors of militarily relevant composite networks. The critical elements of such an ecosystem are identified and described. These include a Campaign of Experimentation (CAMPX) that involves the development of a conceptual model; a series of model-driven experiments; a data repository that contains the results of experiments and analyses of the data; an experimentation infrastructure; and a community of researchers. The importance of ecosystem management and the benefits of an experimentation ecosystem conclude this section of the report. This general discussion of an experimentation ecosystem is followed by a discussion of a multi-threaded campaign of experiments designed to mature our understanding of militarily relevant composite networks that feature the identification of hypotheses and metrics as well as descriptions of three initial experiments. The first of these experiments, Experiment 1, is designed to show that it is feasible, within existing capabilities and facilities, to design and conduct composite network experiments that can explore the interdependencies between and among networks of different genres. The second experiment involves the addition of a third network and an ability to monitor individual and composite network performance to inform dynamic adaption. The final experiment described focuses on being able to integrate cybersecurity measures, metrics, and hypotheses into previous experiments. The report concludes with a proposed way ahead"

        "abstract": "The rapid adoption of mobile devices with cameras has greatly assisted in the proliferation of the creation and distribution of videos. These videos may contain valuable information, which can be exploited to gather information for a variety of purposes. While the computational capability of mobile devices has greatly improved recently, video processing is still a demanding task for mobile devices. Given a network consisting of mobile devices and video-clouds, mobile devices can upload videos to video-clouds, which are much more computationally capable. However, due to networking constraints, when a query is issued, most videos will not likely have been uploaded to the video-clouds, especially when the query is about a recent event. We investigate the problem of minimal query response time for processing videos stored across a network; however, this problem turns out to be a strongly NP-hard problem. As an initial approach, we propose a greedy algorithm with bounded performance. To further deal with the dynamics of the transmission rate between mobile devices and video-clouds, we propose an online algorithm. Experimental results show the performance of the greedy algorithm is close to the optimal and the online algorithm performs better with a more dynamic transmission rate."

        "abstract": "For anyone that wants to leverage the power of Twitter (the most successful microblogging service so far) to spread the word and make an impact, there is one ultimate question: what strategies make a tweet effective? Previous studies use the number of retweets as the measurement of success of a tweet, but we show that two other major forms of user engagements, favorites and replies, are equally important and should not be omitted when measuring user engagements. Through the mining of 122 million engagements of 2.5 million original tweets, we present a systematic review of what factors contribute to a more effective tweet, including the discussions on what is the best time to tweet, how to enrich tweets, how to compose tweets, and what account features will make a difference. We further show that the relationship between many features and tweeting effectiveness is non-linear; for example, using a few hashtags is better than using no or too many hashtags. Finally we conclude our discoveries as 19 effective tweeting strategies, which can be readily used by media, companies, and other Twitter account holders that want to boost tweeting effectiveness."

        "abstract": "The existence of gender differences in the structure and composition of social networks is a well established finding in the social and behavioral sciences, but researchers continue to debate whether structural, dispositional, or life course factors are the primary driver of these differences. In this paper we extend work on gender differences in social networks to patterns of interaction, propinquity, and connectivity captured via a social sensing platform comprised of an ensemble of individuals phone calls, text messaging, face-to-face interactions, and traces of their mobility activities. We attempt to isolate dispositional from other factors by focusing on a relatively homogeneous population on a relatively closed setting at the same stage in the life course. Analysis across three different networks along with mobility data reveals systematic gender differences in terms of communicative, distribu- tional, mobility, and spatial proximity tendencies. Most importantly, some patterns observed in the communication network (e.g. stronger same-gender preference for women) are found to be reversed in the spatial proximity context, with men displaying a greater tendency to spend time in a narrower (and thus more predictable) range of spaces with same-gender peers than women. These findings provide robust and novel evidence for the powerful effect of gender in structuring behavior across a wide range of communication and mobility behaviors, validating and extending recent work pointing to differences of socio-cultural and evolutionary origin in the styles of sociability and interaction characteristic of men and women."

        "abstract": "Pragmatic web aims to migrate the existing web into a system such that user intent can be used to better answer the user needs.  In this regard, we propose a framework that utilizes a pragmatically-aware query refinement framework that resolves an incoming query into a set of possible interpretations (henceforth referred to as a response graph) that could meet the expectations of the user.  Each of the interpretations is assigned a likelihood of being correct, and a Quality of Information (QoI) score is computed to show the expected usefulness of response. We present two schemes---an up-front one-shot algorithm (*static*) and an iterative runtime algorithm (*dynamic*)---for traversing the response graph by considering the querent's intentions. We analyze the performance of these two schemes by presenting data from simulated conversations between a querent and system using randomly generated response graphs. We show that both schemes are able to achieve a significant reduction in the cost to retrieve the desired information, allowing such a system to make intelligent decisions about how to handle and respond to user needs."

These applications have in common the prediction of user trajectories that are in a constant state of flux over a hidden network (e.g. website links, geographic location). But what users are doing now may be unrelated to what they will be doing in an hour from now. Mindful of these challenges we propose TribeFlow, a method designed to cope with the complex challenges of learning personalized predictive models of non-stationary, transient, and time-heterogeneous user trajectories. TribeFlow is a general method that can perform next product recommendation, next song recommendation, next location prediction, and general arbitrary-length user trajectory prediction without domain-specific knowledge. TribeFlow is more ac- curate and up to 413x faster than top competitors."

        "abstract": "Are Online Social Network (OSN) A users more likely to form friendships with those with similar attributes? Do users at an OSN B score content more favorably than OSN C users? Such questions frequently arise in the context of Social Network Analysis (SNA) but often crawling an OSN network via its Application Programming Interface (API) is the only way to gather data from a third party. To date, these partial API crawls are the majority of public datasets and the synonym of lack of statistical guarantees in incomplete data comparisons, severely limiting SNA research progress. Using regenerative properties of the random walks, we propose estimation techniques based on short crawls that have proven statistical guarantees. Moreover, our short crawls can be implemented in massively distributed algorithms. We also provide an adaptive crawler that makes our method parameter-free, significantly improving our statistical guarantees. We then derive the Bayesian approximation of the posterior of the estimates, and in addition, obtain an estimator for the expected value of node and edge statistics in an equivalent configuration model or Chung-Lu random graph model of the given network (where nodes are connected randomly) and use it as a basis for testing null hypotheses. The theoretical results are supported with simulations on a variety of real-world networks."

        "abstract": "Resilience, a system's ability to adjust its activity to retain its basic functionality under errors, failures and environmental changes, is a defining property of many complex systems. Despite widespread consequences on human health, economy and the environment, events leading to loss of resilience, from cascading failures in technological systems to mass extinctions in ecological networks, are rarely predictable and are often irreversible. These limitations are rooted in a theoretical gap: the current analytical framework of resilience is designed to treat low-dimensional models of a few interacting components, being unsuitable for characterizing multi-dimensional systems consisting of a large number of components that interact through a complex network. Here we bridge this theoretical gap by developing a set of analytical tools to identify the natural control and state parameters of a multi-dimensional complex system, helping us derive an effective one-dimensional dynamics that accurately predicts the system's resilience. The proposed analytical framework allows us to systematically separate the role of the system's dynamics and topology, collapsing the behavior of different networks onto a single universal resilience function. The analytical results unveil the network characteristics that can enhance or diminish resilience, offering avenues to prevent the collapse of ecological, biological or economic systems, and guiding the design of technological systems that are resilient to external perturbations and environmental changes alike."

The extinction of species in ecosystems and\nthe blackouts of power girds in engineering exhibit the vulnerability of complex networks,\ninvestigated by empirical data and analyzed by theoretical models. For studying the resilience\nof complex networks, three main factors should be focused on: the network structure, the\nnetwork dynamics and the failure mechanism. In this review, we will introduce recent\nprogress on the resilience of complex networks based on these three aspects. For the\nnetwork structure, increasing evidence shows that biological and ecological networks are\ncoupled with each other and that diverse critical infrastructures interact with each other,\ntriggering a new research hotspot of networks of networks (NON), where a network is\nformed by interdependent or interconnected networks. The resilience of complex networks\nis deeply influenced by its interdependence with other networks, which can be analyzed and\npredicted by percolation theory. This review paper shows that the analytic framework for NON yields novel percolation laws for n interdependent networks and also shows that the\npercolation theory of a single network studied extensively in physics and mathematics in the\nlast 60 years is a specific limited case of the more general case of n interacting networks.\nDue to spatial constraints inherent in critical infrastructures, including the power gird,\nwe also review the progress on the study of spatially-embedded interdependent networks,\nexhibiting extreme vulnerabilities compared to their non-embedded counterparts, especially\nin the case of localized attack. For the network dynamics, we illustrate the percolation\nframework and methods using an example of a real transportation system, where the analysis\nbased on network dynamics is significantly different from the structural static analysis. For\nthe failure mechanism, we here review recent progress on the spontaneous recovery after\nnetwork collapse. These findings can help us to understand, realize and hopefully mitigate\nthe increasing risk in the resilience of complex networks."

Understanding the mechanism behind the cascading failure in NON enables us finding methods to decrease the vulnerability of the natural systems and design of more robust infrastructure systems. By examining the vulnerability of NON under targeted attack and studying the real interdependent systems, we find two methods to decrease the systems vulnerability: (1) protect the high-degree nodes, and (2) increase the degree correlation between networks. Furthermore, the ultimate proof of our understanding of natural and technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. We also review the recent studies and challenges on the controllability of networks and temporal networks."

        "abstract": "Quality of Information (QoI) provides a context-dependent measure of the utility that a network delivers to its users by incorporating non-traditional information attributes. Quickly and easily predicting performance and limitations of a network using QoI metrics is a valuable tool for network design. Even more useful is an understanding of how network components like topology, bandwidth, protocols, etc. impact these limitations. In this paper, we develop a QoI-based framework that can provide this understanding of limitations and impact by modeling the various contributors to delay in the network, including channel rate and contention, competing traffic flows, and multi-hop propagation effects, and relating them to QoI requirements, especially completeness and timeliness. Analysis shows that large tradeoffs exist between network parameters, such as QoI requirements, topology, and network size.  Simulation results also provide evidence that the developed framework can estimate network limits with high accuracy.  Finally, this work also introduces  scalably feasible QoI regions, which provide upper bounds on QoI requirements that can be supported for certain network applications."

        "abstract": "An important challenge in several disciplines is to understand how sudden changes can propagate among coupled systems. Examples include the synchronization of business cycles, population collapse in patchy ecosystems, markets shifting to a new technology platform, collapses in prices and in confidence in financial markets, and protests erupting in multiple countries. A number of mathematical models of these phenomena have multiple equilibria separated by saddle-node bifurcations. We study this behavior in its normal form as fastslow ordinary differential equations. In our model, a system consists of multiple subsystems, such as countries in the global economy or patches of an ecosystem. Each subsystem is described by a scalar quantity, such as economic output or population, that undergoes sudden changes via saddle- node bifurcations. The subsystems are coupled via their scalar quantity (e.g., trade couples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling moves the locations of their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which sudden changes can propagate: they can cascade (one causing the next), or they can hop over subsystems. The latter is absent from classic models of cascades. For an application, we study the Arab Spring protests. After connecting the model to sociological theories that have bistability, we use socioeconomic data to estimate relative proximities to tipping points and Facebook data to estimate couplings among countries. We find that although protests tend to spread locally, they also seem to hop over countries, like in the stylized model; this result highlights a new class of temporal motifs in longitudinal network datasets."

        "abstract": "Location data collection at a societal scale is increas- ingly becoming common - common examples of this are call and data detail records in telecommunication companies, GPS samples from cars in car companies, and GPS samples from mobile devices in mapping companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft). Such large scale mobility datasets have applications in urban planning, network planning, surveillance, and real-time traffic estimations. This paper addresses the problem of subsampling location traces while preserving the amount of information present in such datasets. We propose various information the- oretic measures to quantify the total amount of information in a dataset from a location trace perspective and evaluate these metrics in the context of two large scale mobility datasets from telecommunication companies - one is that of call detail records and the second is that of data detail records. We show that subsampling data in both these cases by as much as 75% does not significantly reduce the total amount of information, i.e. the dataset can be used similar to the original version. This paves way for the creation of better space and CPU efficient models that can support various applications reliant on collective location traces."

        "abstract": "Location traces are becoming fairly abundant with the in- troduction of various mobile devices such as smartphones, in-car navigation units, and video cameras. Each individual type of device generates different features about a mobile entity along with the location of that entity itself. For ex- ample, the smartphone can provide the motion (using ac- celerometer) of an individual, whereas a video camera can identify what type of clothing the person is wearing. A key challenge is to be able to fuse the data across different data sources and generate a unique view for each entity. This pa- per tackles a slice of this larger problem, which is to reconcile entities across a multi-camera network and a GPS trace from a smartphone and proposes a novel algorithm that can scale horizontally to adapt to new age distributed systems such as Apache Spark and IBMs InfoSphere Streams. We show through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset that our algorithm outperforms existing approaches and adapts to horizontally scalable distributed environments."

        "abstract": "Random walk-based graph sampling methods have become increasingly popular and important for characterizing\nlarge-scale complex networks. While powerful, they are known to exhibit problems when the graph is loosely connected, which\nslows down the convergence of a random walk and can result in poor estimation accuracy. In this work, we observe that many\ngraphs under study, called target graphs, usually do not exist in isolation. In many situations, a target graph is often related\nto an auxiliary graph and an affiliation graph, and the target graph becomes better connected when viewed from these three\ngraphs as a whole, or what we called a hybrid social-affiliation network. This viewpoint brings extra benefits to the graph\nsampling framework, e.g., when directly sampling a target graph is difficult or inefficient, we can efficiently sample it with the\nassistance of auxiliary and affiliation graphs. We propose three sampling methods on such a hybrid social-affiliation network\nto estimate target graph characteristics, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of these new sampling methods.

        "abstract": "Because network science is a broad and growing field, it draws researchers from a range of more traditionally established disciplines. These researchers bring with them a variety of different assumptions, approaches, and techniques. These differences can present a challenge when collaborators dont share a common vocabulary or have conflicting assumptions. However, these differences can also present an opportunity when multiple approaches can be combined to form a complete toolset. In particular, physicists, mathematicians, communications hardware engineers, social scientists, psychologists, information management specialists, and data miners have very different ways to conduct experiment design, performance, and analysis \n\nThe NS CTA Integrated Experimentation team has identified five major types of network science experiments used in our program. Each type of experiment can be applied most efficiently to some types of network science questions, and requires different design considerations. The NS CTA and network science in general will benefit from a holistic understanding of how all these types of experiments can be used in conjunction with each other. The purpose of this report is to describe five major types of network science experiments, detailing how each type can be applied to particular types of questions, and highlighting the key requirements, restrictions, and design issues inherent to each type. We hope that NS CTA researchers can use this report to (1) consider how results from their current experiments can feed into different types of experiments across the program, (2) evaluate whether additional types of experiments would advance their tasks research goals, (3) establish greater common understanding of different types of experiments across network science domains.\n"

REM is a blend of social sequence and network analysis (e.g., Cornwell, 2015). It addresses the measure problem by producing a set of sufficient statistics that capture patterned and interdependent interaction over time, and the method issue by using continual and longitudinal inference to model a history of group interactions. The paper is organized as follows. First, we present a general relational event framework for analyzing group interactions processes. Next, we describe the data used for the tutorial analysis. Finally, we demonstrate best practices for using, reporting, and interpreting REM, concluding with some of the most current issues affecting REM."

        "abstract": "Virtual teams are becoming increasingly prevalent across industries and disciplines, yet the effects of virtual environment on team members' perceptions of group processes have not been empirically explored (cf. Hoch & Kozlowski, 2014; MacDuffie, 2007; Maruping & Agarwal, 2004). In the present study, we examined how local environment richness (face-to-face vs. virtual communication media) and intergroup interaction (proximate to members from other teams vs. distant from other teams) impact members perceptions of information interdependence within and between teams.\n\nMedia richness theory (Daft & Lengel, 1984; Daft & Lengel, 1986) posits that communication media vary in their ability process information on a continuum anchored by richer and leaner media. Richer medium, such as face-to-face communication, requires less time to convey and promote understanding while leaner medium, such as email, requires more. Therefore, richer media are traditionally considered more effective for communication. For example, a team member might perceive a lower degree of information interdependence within team due to the effectiveness of face-to-face communication. Conversely, communicating between teams is associated with greater uncertainty and more information to be processed (Daft & Lengel, 1986; Van de Ven, Delbecq, & Koenig, 1976). Therefore, a member might perceive higher degree of information interdependence between teams as results of effective face-to-face communication.\n\nWith regard to intergroup interaction, we test competing predictions regarding its effect on individual perceptions of information interdependence based on two theories: Social identity theory (Tajfel, 1978; Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and the proximity principle (Festinger, Schachter, & Bach, 1950, Newcomb, 1960). Social identity theory (SIT) states that individuals identify with their social groups, and the perceived group membership explains intergroup relations and behaviors. Based on SIT and intergroup contact theory (Allport, 1954), team identity might be more salient for members who are colocated with other teams. These members might be motivated to compete with the members from other teams, and thus, perceive lower information interdependence between teams than within team. By contrast, the proximity principle will predict that a member who is close to other teams might form interpersonal bonds with them, leading to an increase in perceived information interdependence between teams than within team. Furthermore, we expect that these predictions will be moderated by team trust (de Jong, Van der Vegt, & Molleman, 2007; Jones & George, 1998).\n"

        "abstract": "It is increasingly necessary for teams with unique expertise to work together in what are called multiteam systems (MTSs) (Mathieu, Marks, & Zaccaro, 2001). The concept of transactive memory is likely to play a key role in enabling individuals to manage the complex intra- and inter-team relations required in such complex organizational forms. We explore the impact of team context on team TMS. A TMS characterizes the set of information possessed by each member of the team combined with a shared awareness of who knows what (Wegner, 1987). We use a social network approach to understand structural aspects of TMS: similarity and centralization. \n \nWhile within-team communication has been shown to improve TMS similarity (Lewis, 2004; Palazzolo, 2005; and Rulke & Rau, 2000), that isnt necessarily going to be true of between-team communication. An individual can only communicate so much, so the more external communication, the less within-team communication is happening. Additionally, if everyone on the team is communicating externally then everyone is getting different information about the task. Therefore:\n\nHypothesis 1: Team external communication is negatively associated with team TMS similarity.\n\nFurthermore, if people are not communicating within the team about each others expertise, its likely that they are not identifying a single expert for each task thereby decreasing the centralization of the system:\n\nHypothesis 2: Team external communication is negatively associated with team TMS centralization.\n"

This paper proposes an initial framework for optimal lossless compression of subsets of the output of a discrete memoryless source (DMS). It turns out that, the optimal source code may not index the conventional source-typical sequences, but rather index certain subset-typical sequences determined by the source statistics as well as the subset structure. Building upon an achievability and a strong converse, an analytic expression is given, based on the Shannon entropy, relative\nentropy, and subset entropy, which identifies such subset-typical sequences for a broad class of subsets of a DMS. Interestingly,\none often achieves a gain in the fundamental limit, in that the optimal compression rate for the subset can be strictly smaller\nthan the source entropy, although this is not always the case."

        "abstract": "We study a social network in which individuals make decisions influenced by a recommender as well as the previous actions taken by themselves or other users. The recommender aims to tailor its suggestions to maximize the benefit from utilizing social interactions. We refer to this benefit as the recommenders influence which, in essence, measures the value of controlling the specific suggestions offered to the individuals. We show that this influence can be quantified by the directed information between the suggestions and peoples actions. Accordingly, we identify the precise relationship between the social network-based recommendation system and a finite state communication channel whose capacity analysis provides the solution for the influence maximization problem for the recommender. Our results demonstrate that a recommender that tailors its suggestions based on the social dynamics of its customer base can have a significantly greater influence."

        "abstract": "This work considers zero-error interactive computation of an arbitrary function by two users each of whom observes one of two discrete memoryless correlated sources. We provide upper and lower bounds on the minimum worst-case zero-error codeword length, when the joint probability distribution of the two sources is known at both parties. Next, we consider the case when one user knows the true distribution, while the other observes a different but consistent distribution. We study the impact of this knowledge mismatch on the codeword length, by identifying conditions under which perfectly or partially reconciling the distribution information prior to communication is better than using an encoding scheme that ensures zero-error recovery without reconciliation. Considering simultaneous compression of finite blocks of source realizations, our results point to a reconciliation communication tradeoff, in that the minimum codeword length results from a balance between the cost of perfect or partial reconciliation and that of the communication rate; however, reconciliation is always asymptotically optimal.

        "abstract": "As a fundamental task, document similarity measure has broad impact to document-based classification, clustering and ranking. Traditional approaches represent documents as bagof-words and compute document similarities using measures like cosine, Jaccard, and dice. However, entity phrases rather than single words in documents can be critical for evaluating document relatedness. Moreover, types of entities and links between entities/words are also informative. We propose a method to represent a document as a typed heterogeneous information network (HIN), where the entities and relations are annotated with types. Multiple documents can be linked by the words and entities in the HIN. Consequently, we convert the document similarity problem to a graph distance problem. Intuitively, there could be multiple paths between a pair of documents. We propose to use the metapath defined in HIN to compute distance between documents. Instead of burdening user to define meaningful meta-paths, an automatic method is proposed to rank the meta-paths. Given the meta-paths associated with ranking scores, an HIN-based similarity measure, KnowSim, is proposed to compute document similarities. Using Freebase, a well-known world knowledge base, to conduct semantic parsing and construct HIN for documents, our experiments on 20Newsgroups and RCV1 datasets show that KnowSim generates impressive high-quality document clustering."

Researchers use a plethora of KGs like NELL, DBPedia, YAGO to aug- ment their information extraction activities. However, in such diverse and expressive graphs, the access to knowl- edge that matches users needs is not always obvious i.e., user intent does not necessarily get translated into the query interpretation which can frustrate the user. In this work, we present a discourse enabled framework on a large scale KGs as means to start an investigation into modeling user intent for query processing. In this regarding we present a data aware query reformulation strategy with a faceted interface to enable discourse that helps users to specify their needs in an intuitive manner."

Here we show that the economic development of U.S. states may be predicted by using quantitative measures of their social tie network structure derived from location-based social media. We find that long ties, defined here as ties between people in different states, are strongly correlated with economic development in the US states from 2009-2012 in terms of GDP, patents, and number of startups. In contrast, within-state ties are much less predictive of economic development. Our results suggest that such long ties support innovation by enabling more effective idea flow."

        "abstract": "Users who retrieve information across disadvantaged networks need to do so in such a way as to minimize network performance impact while maximizing the usefulness and the quality of information (QOI) received. Taking advantage of features from all three network genres (telecommunication, information, and social) will enable this balancing act. Often, these users need to interact using unstructured, ad-hoc queries to decrease the cognitive overload of specialized training or the necessity of learning a constrained language. High QOI can be maintained if an intelligent agent on the network can use social sensing to capture the intent of the query and identify the implied task. Knowing the task will allow agents that service the requests to filter, summarize, or transcode data prior to responding, lessening the network footprint. This paper describes an approach that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, multi-valued logic based inferencing, network status checking, and task-relevant metrics for information retrieval. This research effort has resulted in: 1) an example-based NLP approach that can be used to capture intent from unstructured text, 2) a quality metric formed from intrinsic and extrinsic attributes of the objects and the tasks under consideration, and 3) a simple inferencing approach to allow intelligent agents to make quality assessments, delivering the appropriate form of the information that will lessen the impact on a disadvantaged network."

        "abstract": "Correctness guarantees are at the core of cyber-physical computing research. While prior research addressed correctness of timing behavior and correctness of program logic, this paper tackles the emerging topic of assessing correctness of input data. This topic is motivated by the desire to crowd-source sensing tasks,\nan act we henceforth call social sensing, in applications with humans in the loop. A key challenge in social sensing is that the reliability of sources is generally unknown, which makes it difficult to assess the correctness of collected observations. To address this challenge, we adopt a cyber-physical approach, where assessment of correctness of individual observations is aided by knowledge of physical constraints on sources and observed variables to compensate for the lack of information on source reliability. We cast the problem as one of maximum likelihood estimation. The goal is to jointly estimate both (i) the latent physical state of the observed environment, and (ii) the inferred reliability of individual sources such that they are maximally consistent with both provenance information (who reported what) and physical constraints. We also derive new analytic bounds that allow the social sensing applications to accurately quantify the estimation error of source reliability for given confidence levels."

        "abstract": "Data embedding is used in many machine learning applications\nto create low-dimensional feature representations, which preserves\nthe structure of data points in their original space. In this paper,\nwe examine the scenario of a heterogeneous network with nodes\nand content of various types. Such networks are notoriously difficult\nto mine because of the bewildering combination of heterogeneous\ncontents and structures. The creation of a multidimensional\nembedding of such data opens the door to the use of a wide variety\nof off-the-shelf mining techniques for multidimensional data.\nDespite the importance of this problem, limited efforts have been\nmade on embedding a network of scalable, dynamic and heterogeneous\ndata. In such cases, both the content and linkage structure\nprovide important cues for creating a unified feature representation\nof the underlying network. In this paper, we design a deep embedding\nalgorithm for networked data. A highly nonlinear multilayered\nembedding function is used to capture the complex interactions\nbetween the heterogeneous data in a network. Our goal is\nto create a multi-resolution deep embedding function, that reflects\nboth the local and global network structures, and makes the resulting\nembedding useful for a variety of data mining tasks. In particular,\nwe demonstrate that the rich content and linkage information\nin a heterogeneous network can be captured by such an approach,\nso that similarities among cross-modal data can be measured directly\nin a common embedding space. Once this goal has been\nachieved, a wide variety of data mining problems can be solved\nby applying off-the-shelf algorithms designed for handling vector\nrepresentations. Our experiments on real-world network datasets\nshow the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithm as\ncompared to the state-of-the-art embedding methods."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the conditions for the emergence of long-range connectivity in a state-less multi-walker non-interfering random walk, when two nearest neighbor nodes have an active edge only if there is at least\none walker at both nodes. We consider a graph G with n nodes, and a multi-walker random walk on that graph with\nm = alpha * _x000B_n independent walkers, with _x000B_ alpha > 0. The walk induces a dynamic graph G'(t) that is a subgraph of G at all times t _x0015_ >= 0. The walkers are assumed to be non-interfering and indistinguishable; meaning each walker at a node at a given time-step, makes the decision on its next hop, uniformly at random (over all nearest-neighbor nodes) and independent of the number (and identity) of walkers currently at those neighboring nodes. We show that there is a critical threshold _x000B_alpha_c, such that when alpha >= alpha__x000B__x0015_ _x000B_c, there exists a giant-connected component (GCC) at all times once the random walk reaches steady state. We show that for an infinite graph G with constant node degree, alpha__x000B_c = -ln(1-q_c) _x0015_>= q_c, where q_c is the site-percolation threshold of G, which is intuitive, in that more walkers are necessary to have a GCC in steady state compared to the number needed in a static configuration where each walker is assigned a unique node at random. We solve for alpha__x000B_c for a configuration graph with degree distribution {p_k} and show that the aforesaid intuition breaks down for complex networks with skewed degree distributions, due to a curious clustering e_x000B_ffect that may enable fewer walkers to trigger a GCC in the mobile case, i.e., alpha__x000B_c < q_c. We also discuss the transient behavior of the GCC and its time stability."

This allows better document analysis, knowledge extraction and knowledge base population.

These systems therefore cannot be easily applied\nto a new language or domain. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised algorithm named Quantified Collective Validation that avoids excessive linguistic analysis on the source documents and fully leverages the knowledge base structure for the entity linking task.

We consider two sets of networks; one contains several networks with real-life communities, the other networks  generated with the Watts-Strogatz and Barabsi-Albert models. For each set, we run NG on all the possible pairs of net-works, each pair with varying number of added links, and observe whether a consensus is reached to determine network features that correlate highly with such outcome. The main conclusion is that the number of nodes and edges correlates highly for the variations of Speaker-First and Listener-First NG respectively with a networks ability to resist or exert influence on others. Moreover, the outcomes depend on whether Speaker-First of Listener-First NG is used and on whether a speaker or listener is biased towards high or low degree nodes. The results reveal strategies that may be used to enable and accelerate convergence to consensus in social networks."

We show that when $q$ exceeds a threshold $q_c(M)$, a giant connected component appears in the $M$-layer network---thereby enabling far-away users to connect using `bridge' nodes that are active in multiple network layers, even though the individual layers may only have small disconnected islands of connectivity. We show that $q_c(M) \\\\lesssim \\\\sqrt{-\\\\ln(1-p_c)}\\\\,/{\\\\sqrt{M}}$, where $p_c$ is the bond percolation threshold of the underlying connectivity graph $G$, and $q_c(1) \\\\equiv q_c$ is its site percolation threshold. We find $q_c(M)$ exactly for when $G$ is a large random network with an arbitrary node-degree distribution. We find $q_c(M)$ numerically for various regular lattices, and find an exact lower bound for the kagome lattice. Finally, we find an intriguingly close connection between this multilayer percolation model and the well-studied problem of site-bond percolation, in the sense that both models provide a smooth transition between the traditional site and bond percolation models. Using this connection, we show a way to translate analytical approximations of the site-bond critical region developed in the 1990s, which are functions only of $p_c$ and $q_c$ of the respective lattice, to excellent general approximations of $q_c(M)$."

However, previous research suggests that simply increasing information without considering how it is presented can lead to worse performance.\n\nMethod: We used a simulated C2 task across two experiments. Experiment 1 varied the volume of information available to individual participants and measured the speed and accuracy of decision-making for task performance. Experiment 2 varied the volume and nature of information available to two participants acting in different roles and assessed decision-making performance, SA, and trust between the paired participants.\n\nResults: In both experiments, the increased volume of information did not improve task performance. In Experiment 2, the increased volume of information reduced self-reported SA and trust. \n\nConclusion: These results indicate that increasing the volume of available information, even when it is accurate and task-relevant, is not necessarily beneficial to decision-making performance. Moreover, it may even be detrimental to SA and trust among team members.\nApplication: Our findings have clear implications for C2 domains, such as military operations and emergency response, given the high volume of available and shared information and the safety-critical and time-sensitive nature of many decisions. This work illustrates there is ample opportunity and need for decision-support systems to assist in fusing, integrating, and presenting information to humans\n"

Many studies have been focused on the synchronization of isolated SPA\nsystems. In real scenarios, different SPA system are coupled with each other forming a\nnetwork of SPA systems. For example, a flock of birds and a school of fish show\npredator-prey relationships and different groups of birds may compete for food. In this\nwork, we propose a general framework to study the collective motion of coupled\nself-propelled agent systems. Especially, we study how three different connections\nbetween SPA systems: symbiosis, predator-prey, and competition influence the\nsynchronization of the network of SPA systems. We find that a network of SPA\nsystems coupled with symbiosis relationship arrive at a complete synchronization as all\nits subsystems showing a complete synchronization; a network of SPA systems coupled\nby predator-prey relationship can not reach a complete synchronization and its\nsubsystems converges to different synchronized directions; and the competitive\nrelationship between SPA systems could increase the synchronization of each SPA\nsystems, while the network of SPA systems coupled by competitive relationships shows\nan optimal synchronization for small coupling strength, indicating that small\ncompetition promotes the synchronization of the entire system."

        "abstract": "Cross-cultural network ties have been shown to improve decision-making, creativity, conflict-resolution and use of collaborative technologies. Nevertheless, cultural barriers are difficult to overcome. We used data from an internal Social Networking System (SNS) in a large global company to see if membership in the same company might reduce the effect of cultural homophily. We found no effect. However, when we focused on members of 87 distributed workgroups, we found that the effect of cultural differences actually reversed, indicating greater cultural diversity in online friendship ties than observed in the company at large. We discuss alternative explanations for this finding and the implications for work environments in global companies."

And how can we prevent spammers from tricking our algorithms into suggesting a bad movie? Is it possible to infer structure between movies simultaneously?\nIn this paper we describe a unified Bayesian approach to Collaborative Filtering that accomplishes all of these goals. It models the discrete structure of ratings and is flexible to the often non-Gaussian shape of the distribution. Additionally, our method finds a co-clustering of the users and items, which improves the model's accuracy and makes the model robust to fraud. We offer three main contributions: (1) We provide a novel model and Gibbs sampling algorithm that accurately models the quirks of real world ratings, such as convex ratings distributions. (2) We provide proof of our model's robustness to spam and anomalous behavior. (3) We use several real world datasets to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting user's ratings, avoiding prediction skew in the face of injected spam, and finding interesting patterns in real world ratings data."

        "abstract": "Social networks such as Twitter carry important information on ongoing events and as such can be viewed as\nnetworks of sensors that monitor and report events in the physical world. An important problem in sensor network literature is that of localization. In the case of monitoring physical events, the localization problem refers to inferring event location from sensor data. In this demonstration, we present a tool that automatically identifies distinct physical events referred to in social network feeds (namely, Twitter feeds) and automatically localizes them. To do so, we designed an algorithm that identifies distinct event signatures in the blogosphere, clusters microblogs based on events they describe, and analyzes the resulting clusters for location information. This information is then translated using the Google Maps API for geo-location, offering a real-time view of ongoing events on a map. To evaluate this tool, we used road traffic related Twitter feeds from San Francisco area in\nCalifornia and corroborate automatic event localization within our service to manually obtained ground truth data. Results show a great correspondence between our automatically determined geo-locations and ground-truth. In the demo, users will be allowed to interact with this and other Twitter data, identify distinct physical events, and locate them in time and space on a map."

        "abstract": "The problem of similarity learning is relevant to many data mining applications, such as recommender systems, classification, and retrieval. This problem is particularly challenging in the context of networks, which contain different aspects such as the topological structure, content, and user supervision. These different aspects need to be combined effectively, in order to create a holistic similarity function. In particular, while most similarity learning methods in networks such as SimRank utilize the topological structure, the user supervision and content are rarely considered. In this paper, a Factorized Similarity Learning (FSL) is proposed to integrate the link, node content, and user supervision into an uniform framework. This is learned by using matrix factorization, and the final similarities are approximated by the span of low rank matrices. The proposed framework is further extended to a noise-tolerant version by adopting a hinge-loss alternatively. To facilitate efficient computation on large-scale data, a parallel extension is developed. Experiments are conducted on the DBLP and CoRA datasets. The results show that FSL is robust, efficient, and outperforms the state-of-the-art."

The lack of large scale object-level annotations and the relative abundance of image-level labels makes a compelling case for weak supervision in the object localization task. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of state-of-the-art methods for the related problem of object recognition. In this paper, we describe a novel object localization algorithm which uses classification networks trained on only image labels. This weakly supervised method leverages local spatial and semantic patterns captured in the convolutional layers of classification networks. We propose an efficient beam search based approach to detect and localize multiple objects in images. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in standard object detection data-sets with a 8 point increase in mAP scores."

        "abstract": "Supporting natural language interface is crucial for accessing knowledge bases (KBs) due to the complexity of their schema. Many natural language interfaces to KBs (NLIKBs) have been built to simplify query formulation and facilitate advanced applications like personal intelligent assistant. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a comprehensive natural language question benchmark that is able to fairly evaluate different NLIKBs in terms of accuracy and runtime. The existing ones, often consisting of ad-hoc, hand-crafted simple questions, are not able to precisely tell the capability of a system in handling questions with different characteristics. \n\nIn this paper, we propose gQuebec (Graph-based Question Benchmark Construction), a framework to construct comprehensive question benchmarks. We automatically generate graph queries from knowledge bases, and employ crowdsourcing to translate these queries into natural language\nquestions. The intermediate step of using graph query differentiates our work from all the previous ones. In those studies, natural language questions are directly generated by human annotators and their characteristics are hard to profile. Using graph queries, we are able to configure questions with an array of controllable characteristics, including query size, commonness, modifier, answer cardinality, and paraphrasing. The benchmark constructed in this way delivers unprecedentedly fine-grained performance profiling, broken down by each question characteristic, which is important for performance comparison and future improvement. We demonstrate that the question-answer pairs generated in gQuebec can be leveraged further as training data to improve the performance of NLIKBs. gQuebec and its open source code will be released to the public."

This work is part of a fully autonomous UAV system which can maneuver to face a single individual in challenging outdoor environments. Our body orientation estimation consists of the following steps: (a) obtaining a set of visual appearance models for each body orientation, where each model is tagged with a set of scene information (obtained from sensors); (b) exploiting the mutual information of on-board sensors using latent-dynamic conditional random fields (LDCRF); (c) Characterizing each visual appearance model with the most discriminative sensor information; (d) fast estimation of body orientation during the test flights given the LDCRF parameters and the corresponding sensor readings. The key aspects of our approach is to add sparsity to the sensor readings with latent variables followed by long range dependency analysis. Experimental results obtained over real-time video streams demonstrate a significant improvement in both speed (15-fps) and accuracy (72%) compared to the state of the art techniques that only rely on visual data. Video demonstration of our autonomous flights (both from ground view and aerial view) are included in the supplementary material."

In this paper, we describe a near real-time multiscale search on a deep CNN feature map that does not use region proposals. The proposed approach effectively exploits local semantic information preserved in the feature map of the outermost convolutional layer. A multi-scale search is performed on the feature map by processing all the sub-regions of different sizes using designated units of fully connected layers. This multi-scale and multi-aspect ratio scanning strategy can effectively localize a potential object of an arbitrary size.

Our approach provides a discriminative learning protocol which is able to simultaneously a) leverage  explicit human knowledge, which are encoded as explicit features,  and b) model the more ambiguous hidden intent, which are encoded as latent features. A latent feature can be carved by any parametric form, which allows it to accommodate arbitrary underlying assumptions. We present our approach in the scenario of check-in preference learning and demonstrate it is capable of modeling user preference in an optimized manner. \n\nCheck-in preference is a fundamental component of Point-of-Interest (POI) prediction and recommendation. A user's check-in can be affected at multiple dimensions, such as the particular time, popularity of the place, his/her category and geographic preference, etc. With the geographic preferences modeled as latent features and the rest as explicit features, our approach provides an in-depth understanding of users' time-varying preferences over different POIs, as well as a reasonable representation of the hidden geographic clusters in a joint manner. Experimental results based on the task of POI prediction/recommendation with two real-world check-in datasets demonstrate that our approach can accurately model the check-in preferences and significantly outperforms the state-of-art models."

        "abstract": "The real-time discovery of local events (e.g., protests, crimes, disasters) is of great importance to various applications, such as crime monitoring, disaster alarming, and activity recommendation. While this task was nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of timely and reliable data sources, the recent explosive growth in geo-tagged tweet data brings new opportunities to it.  That said, how to extract quality local events from geo-tagged tweet streams in real time remains largely unsolved so far.  \n\nWe propose GeoBurst, a method that enables effective and real-time local event detection from geo-tagged tweet streams.  With a novel authority measure that captures the geo-topic correlations among tweets, GeoBurst first identifies several pivots in the query window.  Such pivots serve as representative tweets for potential local events and naturally attract similar tweets to form candidate events. To select truly interesting local events from the candidate list, GeoBurst further summarizes continuous tweet streams and compares the candidates against historical activities to obtain spatiotemporally bursty ones. Finally, GeoBurst also features an updating module that finds new pivots with little time cost when the query window shifts. As such, GeoBurst is capable of monitoring continuous streams in real time. We used crowdsourcing to evaluate GeoBurst on two real-life data sets that contain millions of geo-tagged tweets. The results demonstrate that GeoBurst significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, and is orders of magnitude faster."

        "abstract": "To systematically analyze large numbers of textual documents, it is often desirable to manage documents (and their metadata) in a multi-dimensional semantic space (hence text cube). To digest sets of documents in a multi-dimensional and semantically meaningful way, we introduce the concept of Context-Aware Semantic Online Analytical Processing (i.e., CASeOLAP) in text cubes, and use top-k representative phrases to represent the semantics of the document subset in a text cube cell. By ranking phrases with a newly proposed ranking measure according to three criteria: integrity of the phrases as integral semantic units, popularity in the subset and distinctiveness of the subset from other documents, we identify phrases that can successfully digest the main content of a subset of documents of interest and contrast with other neighboring subsets. We develop an efficient solution to implement such semantic OLAP mechanismby taking documents and their metadata as input, constructing a text cube, materializing a selected part of statistics, and using these statistics to perform online query processing within a constant latency constraint. Our experiments in a large news dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed ranking measure in finding representative phrases and the efficiency in both query processing time and storage cost."

For each event, Eknot provides multi-dimensional summaries: a) a summary from news for an objective description; b) a summary from tweets containing opinions/sentiments; c) an entity graph which illustrates the major players involved and their correlations; d) the time span of the event; and e) an opinion (sentiment) distribution. Also, if a user is interested in a particular event, he/she can zoom into this event to investigate its aspects (sub-events) summarized in the same manner.

The present study uses M3D as a frame of reference for reviewing computer and information science studies that utilize large social datasets to examine how messages are propagated online. Our structured review of literature took place in two stages: the overview stage where we systematically searched for articles from engineering-specific platforms, and the review stage where we classified articles into the six levels outlined in M3D. Findings indicate that computer and information science journals are primarily interested in empirically testing the social network and geotechnical levels of meme diffusion, and less attention were given to the meme and individual levels. This offers an opportunity to bridge computer and social science, in which social science provide theoretical frameworks for computer scientists to empirically test memetic diffusion at all M3D levels using data-rich models and simulations."

        "abstract": "The proliferation of social networks with large scale information dissemination capabilities, such as Twitter, significantly increases the degree of observability of critical events, such as natural or man-made disasters. This paper analyzes the extent to which critical physical events indeed are observable, thanks to social networks, as well as the extent to which the offered view into event state that affects the states own evolution. As a case study, we investigate the gas shortage that ensued around New York City in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in November 2012. Both ground truth data regarding the shortage as well as Twitter data describing it are collected. Results suggest that the social network responds to the shortage in a manner that enables (noisy) reconstruction of actual damage evolution. Non-linear models of social response tend to t the data better, suggesting that the response switches from an initial rational reaction to a subsequent panic reaction that is largely a function of its own history, as opposed to that of the physical event. Deriving a good model of this (over)reaction is therefore critical for correct reconstruction of the actual damage. Similarly, the paper presents models for actual damage and demonstrates that combining social response with actual damage can improve the damage modeling capability.\n"

Various hypotheses include inefficiency in sharing information leading to decisions based on incomplete information or cognitive inefficiencies in processing and storing information arriving in a\npiecemeal fashion. The present study attacks this problem from two directions. Human experiments are used to compare decisions between groups manipulated to receive and share information in raw and aggregated forms and mixed groups comprised of humans and software agents.

        "abstract": "In networked organizations, a common assumption is that information sharing improves situation awareness and ultimately organizational effectiveness. The sheer volume and rapid pace of information and communications received and readily accessible through computer networks, however, can overwhelm individuals resulting in data overload from diverse data sources, multiple data formats, and large data volumes. The current conceptual framework of network enabled operations (NEO) posits that robust networking and information sharing act as a positive feedback loop resulting in greater situation awareness and mission effectiveness in military operations (Alberts & Garstka, 2004). We test this assumption in a large-scale two-week military training event exercise. We conducted a social network analysis of email communications among the multi-echelon Mission Command staff (one Division and two sub-ordinate Brigades) and assessed the situation awareness of every individual. Results from our exponential random graph models challenge this assumption as increased email output was associated with lower individual situation awareness. It emerged that higher situation awareness was associated with a lower probability of out-ties, so that broadly sending many messages decreased the likelihood of attaining situation awareness. This challenges the hypothesis that increased information sharing improves situation awareness, at least for those doing the bulk of the sharing. In addition, we observed two trends that reflect a compartmentalizing of networked information sharing as email links were more commonly formed among members of the command staff with both similar functions and levels of situation awareness, than between two individuals with dissimilar functions and levels of situation awareness; both those findings can be interpreted to reflect effects of homophily. Our results have major implications that challenge the current conceptual framework of network-enabled operations. In addition, the information sharing network was largely imbalanced and dominated by a few key individuals so that most individuals in the network have very few email connections, but a small number of individuals have very many connections. These results highlight several major growing pains for networked organizations and military organizations in particular."

Specifically, TeamPhone consists of two components: a messaging system and a self-rescue system. The messaging system integrates cellular networking, ad-hoc networking and opportunistic networking seamlessly, and enables communications among rescue workers. The self-rescue system energy-efficiently groups the smartphones of trapped survivor and sends out emergency messages so as to assist rescue operations. We have implemented TeamPhone as a prototype application on the Android platform and deployed it on off-the-shelf smartphones. Experiment results show that TeamPhone can properly fulfill communication requirements and greatly facilitate rescue operations in disaster recovery."

Different from existing work, in this paper, we focus on cooperatively offloading data among mobile devices to maximally improve the probability of data delivery from a mobile device to an intermittently connected remote server or data center within a given time constraint, which is referred to as the \\\\textit{cooperative offloading} problem. Unfortunately, cooperative offloading is NP-hard. To this end, a heuristic algorithm is designed based on the proposed probabilistic framework, which provides the estimation of the probability of successful data delivery over the opportunistic path, considering both data size and contact duration. Due to the lack of global information, a distributed algorithm is further proposed. The performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated based on both synthetic networks and real traces, and simulation results show that cooperative offloading can significantly improve the data delivery probability and the performance of both heuristic algorithm and distributed algorithm outperforms other approaches."

        "abstract": "The naming game has become an archetype for linguistic evolution and mathematical social behavioral analysis. In the model there are N individuals and K words, and we primarily consider arbitrary K. In particular, we develop a robust method that handles the case when K = O(N). The initial condition plays a crucial role in the ordering of the system. We find that if the system has high Shannon entropy, then the system has a higher consensus time and a lower critical fraction of zealots compared to low entropy states. We also provide estimates which show that the critical number of committed agents decreases with the number of opinions, and grows with the community size for each word. These results reinforce the maxims divide and conquer and strength in numbers in opinion propagation."

        "abstract": "The *big data* era is characterized by an explosion of information in the form of digital data collections, ranging from scientific knowledge, to social media, news, and everyone's daily life. Examples of such collections include scientific publications, enterprise logs, news articles, social media, and general web pages. Valuable knowledge about multi-typed entities is often hidden in the unstructured or loosely structured, interconnected data. Mining latent structures around entities uncovers hidden knowledge such as implicit topics, phrases, entity roles and relationships. In this monograph, we investigate the principles and methodologies of mining latent entity structures from massive unstructured and interconnected data. We propose a text-rich information network model for modeling data in many different domains. This leads to a series of new principles and powerful methodologies for mining latent structures, including (1) latent topical hierarchy, (2) quality topical phrases, (3) entity roles in hierarchical topical communities, and (4) entity relations. This book also introduces applications enabled by the mined structures and points out some promising research directions."

        "abstract": "Many text mining approaches adopt bag-of-words or n-grams models to represent documents. Looking beyond just the words, i.e., the explicit surface forms, in a document can improve a computers understanding of text. Being aware of this, researchers have proposed concept-based models that rely on a human-curated knowledge base to incorporate other related concepts in the document representation. But these methods are not desirable when applied to vertical domains (e.g., literature, enterprise, etc.) due to low coverage of in-domain concepts in the general knowledge base and interference from out-of-domain concepts. In this paper, we propose a data-driven model named Latent Keyphrase Inference (LAKI ) that represents documents with a vector of closely related domain keyphrases instead of single words or existing concepts in the knowledge base. We show that given a corpus of in-domain documents, topical content units can be learned for each domain keyphrase, which enables a computer to do smart inference to discover latent document keyphrases, going beyond just explicit mentions. Compared with the state-of-art document representation approaches, LAKI fills the gap between bag-of-words and concept-based models by using domain keyphrases as the basic representation unit. It removes the dependency on a knowledge base while providing, with keyphrases, readily interpretable representations. When evaluated against 8 other methods on two text mining tasks over two corpora, LAKI outperformed all."

        "abstract": "We explore the co-evolution of social and information networks using a variation on the Naming Game where each individual has an opinion vector, and interactions either influence the opinion vector of one of the parties or catalyze rewiring of the social link, depending on whether a threshold of opinion similarity. This model has previously been used to explore how a society reaches global or local consensus, whether the society breaks into smaller networks, and the impact of a minority committed to particular opinions. We expand the model by generalizing from a social network defined by pairwise links to a social network defined by membership in potentially overlapping groups; the pairwise link network can be considered a special case where all groups are of size 2. Here, we consider the case where all groups in the society are of size 3. Instead of the interaction occurring between two individuals, in our more general case, it occurs between an individual and the other members of a group. Our results show that including group-based interactions in a model of opinion dynamics decreases the tendency of a society to fragment and increases its tendency toward stable non-consensus.\n\nFigure 1 shows the size of the largest connected network component as a function of the number of possible opinion values per topic (v), illustrating how differences of opinion can drive a societys tendency to evolve into multiple disconnected networks. Basing a simulation on a previously studied model[arXiv:1110.0347] for ER networks of 200 nodes, using 5 topics and a similarity threshold 3, we compare societies with group sizes (S) of 2 and 3, with a range the number of groups a node belongs to (K) ranging from 2-8. We also consider the effective K (KE), the number of other individuals that any particular individual can influence. K an KE are identical when S=2, but for S=3, KE has the maximum value 2K. KE is calculated by finding the average degree for nodes in the graph resulting from each group being represented by a clique of size 3.\n\nComparing the lines for K=4, we see that networks with S=3 are much more likely than networks of S=2 to remain nearly completely connected and to fail to reach consensus. When KE=6, networks with S=2 show multiple phases in the graph, moving from a highly connected, global consensus state (left) to a fragmented local consensus state (middle) to a mostly connected non-consensus state (right) as v increases. Networks with S=3 are much less sensitive to the number of opinion values, with both global consensus and non-consensus outcomes possible regardless of v. Any fragmentation of the network for S=3 is very minor compared with S=2.\n\nWhen comparing societies with the same average number of relationships per individual, societies where relationships consist of membership in small groups rather than pairwise links are more stable to fragmentation driven by opinion differences, and stable non-consensus states are easier to maintain. This suggests that group-based interactions may be responsible for real-world opinion dynamics phenomena, such as persistent large connected networks and non-consensus states. "

For the experiment, we adapt the Wildcat Wells framework developed by Mason and Watts (2012). In this framework, individuals search for the most oil and are able to learn about the location of oil from their neighbors. We operationalize five network types representing equivalent simplicial and graph-theoretic networks. We then run subjects in these networks and measure how much oil subjects in each network discover. The results support our hypothesis that simplicial complexes capture empirical differences when subjects in the simplicial conditions perform better than their counterparts in graph-theoretic networks."

        "abstract": "Efficient flow of command-and-control (C2) through social networks is critical for the execution of certain network functions. Examples include finding and routing queries among experts for troubleshooting of technical problems and chain-of-command hierarchies in civilian and military organizations. While static predefined networks for C2 are the norm, modern organizations often want to adopt less rigid structures that vary over time for faster operational tempo to achieve some common purpose. A usual reason for such adaptation is when this common purpose is in conflict with another entitys purpose, hence the presence of an adversary, who is continually trying to disrupt links in the existing network to put it in a non-functional or suboptimal state. An adversary can disrupt a social link by disrupting the physical communication media over which the social relationship thrives. Alternatively, he can inject spurious messages and attempt to weaken the tie. If the adversary can disrupt critical links in the social network, the information flow properties of the network can change substantially. For example, the disruption of a bridge link between two communities will completely stop the information flow between them. Similarly, if one of the two existing bridge endpoints is disrupted, certain information may stop flowing between the communities or the endpoints of the surviving bridge may get cognitively overloaded, thus resulting in a significant disruption to the information flow patterns.\nThis dynamic of a network designer and adversary is applicable to a variety of operational networks, particularly in C2 environments. The C2 research domain uses the definition of agility as the means to successfully effect, cope with and/or exploit changes in circumstances. We study the capability of maneuver as a means for an organization to switch between various organizational topologies in order to increase its performance in the presence of an adversary. As an extension to this concept, we note the dynamics of organizations and the environment, both components of a large, complex system that are constantly evolving. Therefore, we study the efficacy of a strategy to maneuver between a set of policy-compliant topologies in the presence of an adversarial attack.\nWe capture the tension between an adversary and a designer using non-cooperative game theory. The designer is faced with the dilemma of defending an existing link under attack or growing the current network to the next best topology, while the adversary is faced with the dilemma of which link to attack. We show the existence of mixed strategy Nash Equilibria and systematically study their properties. We study the effect of parameters such as the probability of a successful attack and characterize the steady state behavior of the resultant Markov Chain. While the intuitive adversarial strategy here is to attack links added early in the topology sequence, the best equilibrium strategy is for the designer to defend the earlier links and for the adversary to attack the later links.\nWe validate these properties through several use cases with exemplar network topologies."

        "abstract": "Work groups and teams are functional units designed to collectively accomplish a set of tasks or problems using their combined expertise. The quality of interaction and collaboration within these sets of individuals often influences the performance of the team. As a result, there is a significant body of literature that studies the effective formation of teams, the assignment of teams to tasks, and the processes by which teams complete their tasks. However, it is often the case that a set of individuals must continue to work together for an extended period of time, and therefore face multiple sets of tasks as part of a greater mission. In this scenario, the team structure that effectively solves one set of tasks may not be the best structure to solve potential future tasks. Consequently, the most productive group over a time span is one that balances the needs of the present with the potential needs of the future. This combination of tasks, individuals, and a collaboration network over time forms a dynamic task collaboration network system. The goal of this study is to propose a mathematical framework that can determine an optimal strategy for forming and reconfiguring (or switching) teams with respect to a series of tasks. \nFor the purely myopic case, the problems of team formation and team assignment can often be solved using network methods. Specifically, we assume that group members are represented as nodes, and there are weighted edges between the nodes representing the collaboration cost of those two individuals working together. Tasks may also be represented as nodes, with edges connecting these nodes to the nodes of the workers assigned to the problem. A temporary team is then formed when multiple individuals are assigned to the same task. The optimal assignment of individuals to tasks is typically accomplished by finding a cover in the bipartite worker-task network, while minimizing the collaboration cost that is incurred as a result of the teams created. \nThe incorporation of time into this problem adds an additional layer of complexity. Reconfiguring the structure of a set of teams may cause some degree of process loss due to a variety of factors, even if the new configuration is optimal for the present set of tasks. Thus, an optimal team assignment over a period of time must consider the tasks at the present time, as well as the future tasks the group will potentially face. The arrival of these future tasks could be deterministic or probabilistic. To effectively solve this problem, we propose a stochastic dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal policy of team formation and team switching. The decisions of whether to switch teams or not in a dynamic task collaboration network system can be modeled within the well-known Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. For a well-defined set of potential states, actions, transition probabilities, and cost functions, this problem may be solved. We discuss the structure of this problem and potential applications, as well as possible challenges and limitations."

Instead, to characterize scientific impact, we address two analogous questions asked by many scientific researchers: How will my h-index evolve over time, and which of my previously or newly published papers will contribute to it? To answer these questions, we perform two related tasks. First, we develop a model to predict authors future h-indices based on their current scientific impact. Second, we examine the factors that drive paperseither previously or newly publishedto increase their authors predicted future h-indices. By leveraging relevant factors, we can predict an authors h-index in five years with an R2 value of 0.92 and whether a previously (newly) published paper will contribute to this future h-index with an F1 score of 0.99 (0.77). We find that topical authority and publication venue are crucial to these effective predictions, while topic popularity is surprisingly inconsequential. Further, we develop an online tool that allows users to generate informed h-index predictions. Our work demonstrates the predictability of scientific impact, and can help researchers to effectively leverage their scholarly position of standing on the shoulders of giants. "

Each team was presented with the same initial situation and asked for the same set of deliverables, but participant interactions with each other and with a set of non-player characters (NPCs) caused divergence between teams.

This model has previously been used to explore how a society reaches global or local consensus, whether the society breaks into smaller networks, and the impact of a minority committed to particular opinions. We expand the model by generalizing from a social network defined by pairwise links to a social network defined by membership in potentially overlapping groups; the pairwise link network can be considered a special case where all groups are of size 2. Here, we consider the case where all groups in the society are of size 3. Instead of the interaction occurring between two individuals, in our more general case, it occurs between an individual and the other members of a group. Our results show that including group-based interactions in a model of opinion dynamics decreases the tendency of a society to fragment and increases its tendency toward stable non-consensus."

        "abstract": "Counterproductivity hinders individual members performances as well as team performance. For example, Sparrowe and colleagues (2001) have argued that withholding valuable information, resources, and opportunities hinder others from doing their work. The theory of counterproductive work behavior (CWB; Rotundo & Sackett, 2002) states that hindering other team members is costly for the team as it negatively influence the performance of others (Duffy & Lee, 2012; Lam et al., 2011) and has ripple effects across the team (Barsade, 2002).\nWhile there is evidence for the effects of hindrance, less is known about the emergence of hindrance networks in particular and negative networks in general  (Everett & Borgatti, 2014). This study extends  prior research conducted on negative networks and social processes (e.g., Barrera, 2008; Daly et al, 2015; Marineau et al., 2016; Roda, 2014) by focusing specifically on the emergence of structural signatures in hindrance networks.  Based on social exchange theory, we hypothesize that hinderance ties will be reciprocated  (Emerson, 1976). Drawing on the literature on scapegoating (Rothschild et al., 2012), we posit that one or a few individuals will be targeted as the source of hindrance ties by many others. Finally building on self-serving bias theory, we hypothesize that one or a few individuals will report being hindered by many others who they attribute as the cause of their bad performance (Campbell & Sedikides, 1999).\n\nIn addition to the three endogenous explanations for the emergence of structural signatures in the hindrances networks outlined above, we also examine the extent to which individuals attributes influence the structure of hindrance networks. Research on networks with negative relationships have demonstrated that a person's personality influences his or her position in the negative network (Klein, Saltz, & Mayer, 2005; Xia, Connie, & Gay, 2009). According to CWB theory (Martinko, Gundlach, & Douglas, 2002), individual differences in traits, such as the Big 5 personality factors, lead to counterproductive behaviors. A meta-analysis on common correlates of counterproductivity shows that agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability are negatively associated with counterproductivity (Berry, Ones, & Sackett, 2007). The literature has not considered the relational aspects of counterproductive influence and personality. Specifically, the literature has not simultaneously considered the sender and receivers personality factors in explaining the perceptions of hindrance between team members.\n\nBased on CWB theory, we hypothesize that members with lower levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability are more likely to be perceived by others, or perceive others, as a hinderance. In addition, we examine how the emergence of hinderance ties are influenced by personality compatibility which measure similarity between members on the same personality characteristics,  such as high versus low conscientiousness  (Labianca, 2014) and personality interactions, which examines matching different personality characteristics such as high agreeableness and high consciousness (Witt et al., 2002). We use ERGMs to test these hypotheses in 30 20-person teams."

        "abstract": "Each group member's knowledge combined with their shared understanding of who knows what constitute a group-level transactive memory system (TMS; Wegner, 1986, 1987). Over the last three decades, scholars have examined a number of TMS characteristics. These include complexity, accuracy, agreement (Moreland 1999), knowledge stock, knowledge specialization, consensus, and accuracy (Austin, 2003), memory differentiation, task coordination, and task credibility (Liang et al., 1995; Moreland, 1999; Moreland & Myaskovsky, 2000). There is widespread agreement that specialization of knowledge distribution in teams is an important characteristic of TMS and has important implications for the cooperative division of labor for cognitive processes (Wegner, 1987).\n\nThere have been a number of conceptual approaches to specialization. Some of the relevant constructs include differential information distribution (Stasser & Titus, 1985), role specialization (Kilduff, Angelmar, & Mehra, 2000), diversity of expertise (Rau, 2001), memory differentiation (Liang et al., 1995; Moreland & Myaskovsky, 2000), knowledge specialization (Austin, 2003, Lewis, 2003), and knowledge differentiation (Palazzolo, Serb, She, Su, & Contractor, 2006). Under the various conceptualizations, specialization has been measured in different ways. One approach to measure specialization involves group members self-reports about the level of specialization in the group (Kilduff et al., 2000; Lewis, 2003). This method assesses members subjective perceptions about the general level of specialization and does not require asking team members about specific expertise. Another approach involves measuring objective specialization by asking each team member to identify an expert for different tasks and calculating each members specialization score. For instance, Austin (2003) measured group task knowledge specialization by first computing a standard deviation score of how frequently each member was nominated as an expert on different tasks by other team members and averaging the members scores to achieve the group specialization score. This measure adequately captures the level of specialization for each team member across tasks but does not distinguish if one members expertise is different from another members expertise.\n\nThe purpose of the current study is to define and measure specialization in teams in a manner that captures the presence of experts as well as the uniqueness of team members expertise. Therefore, we define team specialization as the extent to which team members are the sole experts in a given area. We develop and compare four metrics of specialization in a team using a bipartite incidence network linking people with the expertise they are perceived to posses by other team members: (1) inter-item correlation, (2) Jaccard index, (3) Euclidean distance, and (4) t-statistic of specific structural signatures that capture specialization using exponential random graph model (ERGM). We compare the fidelity of these metrics with the conceptual underpinnings of specialization articulated in TMSs. By doing so, the present study contributes to the literature on TMS by providing novel metrics to assess specialization in teams."

        "abstract": "Recently, network researchers have taken advantage of modeling networks as relational events, rather than as relational states (e.g., QAP, ERGM, SIENA). Relational event modeling (REM) has a number of advantages, namely being able to model each network interaction at each specific time point. However, REM largely resembles an information-based theory of communication that has received heavy criticism in the field. It fails to account for when everybody is the alter or when no alter is specifically the target in a network. In these open communication networks (e.g., Facebook status update, same Walkie Talkie channel, group Snapchat), everybody is the receiver  or individuals chose to be an alter of a message that any ego can generate.\nTo overcome this limitation, we use Markov chain modeling and the recently developed ego-centric REM developed by the statnet team to analyze a multi-team system (MTS) experiment in which the communication network was open. That is, when somebody sends a message, there is no predetermined receiver, everybody in the MTS can hear it (or chose to ignore it). Results indicate that groups enacted different patterns and that there was a significant interaction effect between cross-team turn taking and MTS coordination. MTS coordination was measured as the extent to which the MTS was successfully able to orchestrate their charge to a common area to neutralize insurgents. The results replicate earlier results in which dyadic REM was used when a more restricted network condition was manipulated."

        "abstract": "Theories of Social and Communication Networks have advanced our understanding of social networks with the drivers of social ties such as homophily, exchange, and balance. However one of the factors missing from the picture is agency, especially individual agency. Individual agency has richness and impact beyond a simple node in a social network. A person could act as an agent of change affecting greater networks. Rather than the drivers for social and communication networks, we focus on agency. The agency ties and organizes together in an ideally optimal way the drivers for the formation, maintenance, and dissolution of social and communication networks. A person who needs to make life-impacting decisions about who to talk to, what to do, etc. is influenced by own preferential principles for networking and decision making will integrate in a specific way homophily, risk attitudes, exchange, opposition moves, balance, time constraints, coevolution, financial constraints, and/or other relevant factors in making a decision and act as a unique agency. Agency affects networks and networks contextually impact agencyego-networks hint about agency characteristics.\nWe report progress on building an agency-focused agent-model of network reticulation, extending the Reticulation Theory that integrated activity and networks and elucidated the nature and connections among enactment, activation, and reticulation in structuring networks, forming coding conventions, and manifesting foci of activities. The agency is modeled by treating network nodes as agents with their own individual motives and networking tendencies rather than treating actors as belonging to simple classes. An agent in a network each has its own goals, roles, time, beliefs, tasks, task structures, plans, communication, performance measures, activities related to tasks, enactments related to goals and events, reticulation related to communication, among other factors. The agent has potentially conflicting information and situations, and has to obtain situation awareness and construct a common operating picture. At the heart of the decision making processes of an agent, we have traces and workflows of how a decision is made based on the above factors, and of how a common operating picture is constructed. Examining these traces and workflows for significant graphs, a decision model is generated. Additionally, decision making meta-model algorithms learns from prior action outcomes. We use Red-Blue IED Game and its gameplays by human players to inform and instantiate our model. The game simulates the battle for hearts and minds of a village between friendly (Blue) team with agents such as commander, patrol, aid convoy, and enemy (Red) team with bombmaker, digger, financier agents. The Blue team clears the roads of bombs and enemies to provide villagers with security and aid, while the Red team finances and plants bombs to hinder the Blue team.\nWe aim to build an integrative theory of network structuration through multi-agent agency network modeling. Each agent acts based upon own agency with consideration for the preferential principles for networking and decision making. Homophily, balance, exchange, etc. are integrated and reasoned with to infer agent decisions, as well as are other factors such as agents roles, needs, constraints, and experience."

        "abstract": "We consider multi-genre networks composed of social networks and communication networks. These networks can represent groups of people and the technology that connects them. In many situations, the group joins together in some common purpose, while external or environmental conditions tend to hamper the performance of these networks. Within this multi-genre network, we can consider the social network as an overlay network to the underlying communications network. This implies dependence of the social network with the communications network. Any impairment of performance on the communication network will affect the social network, thus the entire networks performance. However, agility of the social network may allow for the performance of the overall network to thrive despite a diminished performance of the communications network layer.\nWe study the agility of composite social and communications networks through computer simulation of a distributed organization engaged in information sharing and decision-making across an imperfect communications network infrastructure. Within certain networked environments, we can consider Command and Control (C2) Agility, which has been defined as the capability of an organization to successfully effect, cope with and/or exploit changes in circumstances. By simultaneously simulating aspects of individual cognition, organizational policy, information composition, and infrastructure limitations, we are able to explore how cross-network interactions result in fragility or robustness of performance.\nRecent research results have defined enablers of agility as responsiveness, versatility, flexibility, resilience, adaptiveness, innovativeness. With such characteristics in multi-genre networks, we study the idea that agility of the individual network layers being able to provide agility to the overall multigenre network. To explore these claims, we conduct a set of experiments using a communications network emulator, EMANE, and a command and control experimentation platform, ELICIT. Our results demonstrate how different Command and Control policies about information sharing determine agility."

        "abstract": "Increasingly, social network data include time-stamped events such as emails, text messages, and interactions with a website. Relational event models (REM) are statistical tools designed to predict how generative behavioral, cognitive, and social mechanisms contribute to future events in a network. The primary advantage of the relational event framework is that the exact sequence and timing of actions are directly observed. Because of this high temporal granularity, distinct patterns can be modeled, including exogenous effects, endogenous effects, node or relational covariates, and environmental effects. REM is being utilized to study team process. Process is a broad concept that encompasses all aspects of how a team works towards its collective goal. REM is particularly well suited to understanding the micro-level dynamics of teamwork. But theories of team processes suggest that these micro-level events influence, and are in turn influenced by, individuals affective and relational states (which are not events).. Individuals actions and interactions - which are both events occurring at a specific point in time for a specific duration - co-evolve with their individual attributes (such as expertise) and relations (such as trust with one another) which are both states that unlike events dont occur sporadically. It is therefore conceptually critical to model the dynamic co-evolution of events and states to understand the team processes.\nThis notion of coevolution is well established in traditional stochastic actor-oriented models. These models consider a series of discrete time observations, with each observation consisting of a static network and a set of attributes. The change between these static states was then modeled as a (hidden) Markov process. The key limitation to this method is the lack of granularity; the micro-level changes that inherently must occur over time are impossible to know, and as a result simulation must be used to guess the intermediate dynamics. However, under the relational event paradigm the exact sequence of events that occurred from point A to point B is now visible, and can be used to inform our inference on the behavioral changes. However, as we argue above, a key limitation to contemporary versions of REM is its inability to incorporate the coevolution of state variables with these event variables. The key methodological advancement in our research is the integration of relational event data with the traditional stochastic actor-oriented network coevolution model. We maintain the structure and logic of the stochastic actor-oriented co-evolutionary model. We leverage the granularity of newly available relational event data, when available, leading to a higher degree of fidelity and greater freedom in defining sufficient statistics. However we retain the simulated network micro-steps utilized by the original actor-oriented model to estimate changes in states. We present a mathematical formulation of the integrated framework and discuss potential network statistics. We also illustrate the use of our model for the study of team processes."

        "abstract": "Collaboration and teamwork are increasingly a prevalent and necessary part of society at large. Complex problems require interdisciplinary teams to combine disparate knowledge. Although complex problems require diversity, human nature shows a general preference toward homophily. This creates a fundamental tension in team assembly. In choosing teammates, the individual must balance an attraction to the familiar with an often competing need for expertise variety. This paper explores the implicit rules individuals use in choosing teammates.\nWe do so by observing teammate selection in a web-based team assembly platform called My Dream Team (MDT). We used MDT to help 213 individuals from two different organizations assemble into 5-7 member interorganizational-interdisciplinary teams. They used MDT to identify potential teammates that match their preferences, invite them to form a team, and respond (accept or decline) to invitations they received from others. The invitation and response messages were used to generate networks representing these different steps in the team assembly process. The structure of the directed invitation and response networks  provide valuable insights into the mechanisms, like homophily, that influence the assembly of teams.\nUsing exponential random graph models (ERGM) of the invitation networks, we test the extent to which theories of homophily (similar attributes) and multiplexity (prior ties) influence the team assembly process. We tested the influence of homophily along three different dimensions: discipline (H1a), gender (H1b), and age (H1c). We also tested hypotheses for two forms of multiplexity: prior friendship (H2a) and enjoying working previously (H2b) with the person. ERGM analyses did not support homophily effects on discipline, gender, or age. However, ERGM analyses supported the role of multiplexity in team assembly. Individuals were more likely to invite their friends (OR = 27.1) or people with whom they previously enjoyed working (OR = 28.2). In this talk, we also present findings examining homophily and multiplexity mechanisms in the team invitation response networks (i.e., acceptance or rejection ties) and the role of individual characteristics, such as personality traits, on homophily- and multiplexity-based team assembly.\nThese findings that individuals do not use homophily but rely on existing networks when choosing teammates may evidence a functional strategy by individuals whereby basic needs for predictability are met not by choosing to work with similar individuals, but choosing to work with known individuals. Using multiplexity instead of homophily to ensure predictability in ones teammates is potentially beneficial to the resulting diversity of the team. However, given research on the value of newcomers, this assembly strategy may hinder team creativity and minority dissent."

        "abstract": "Real-world complex systems interact with one another, and these interactions increase the probability of catastrophic failure.\nUsing interdependent networks to model these phenomena helps understand system's robustness and enables design of more robust infrastructures. \nPrevious research has been limited to an idealized case where each layer is undirected, but almost all real-world networks are directed and exhibit in-degree and out-degree correlations. Therefore, we develop a general theoretical framework for analyzing the breakdown of interdependent directed networks with, or without, in-degree and out-degree correlations, and apply it to real-world international trade networks. Surprisingly, we find that the robustness of interdependent heterogeneous networks increases, while that of interdependent  homogeneous networks with strong coupling strengths decreases with in-degree and out-degree correlations."

        "abstract": "Given a graph query Q posed on a knowledge graph G, top-k graph querying is to find k matches in G with the highest ranking score according to a ranking function. Fast top-k search in knowledge graphs is challenging as both graph traversal and similarity search are expensive. Conventional top-k graph search is typically based on threshold algorithm (TA), which can no long fit the demand in the new setting.  \n\nThis work proposes STAR, a top-k knowledge graph search framework. It has two components: (a) a fast top-k algorithm for star queries, and (b) an assembling algorithm for general graph queries. The assembling algorithm uses star query as a building block and iteratively sweeps the star match lists with a dynamically adjusted bound. For top-k star graph query where an edge can be matched to a path with bounded length d, we develop a message passing algorithm, achieving time complexity O(d2|E| + md) and space complexity linear to d|V | (assuming the size of Q and k is bounded by a constant), where m is the maximum node degree in G. STAR can further be leveraged to answer general graph queries by decomposing a query to multiple star queries and joining their results later. Learning-based techniques to optimize query decomposition are also developed. We experimentally verify that STAR is 5-10 times faster than the state-of-the-art TA-style subgraph search algorithm, and 10-100 times faster than a belief propagation approach."

Traditional truth discovery task aims to identify the truth the most trustworthy information, from conicting sources in dierent scenarios. In this kind of tasks, truth is regarded as a xed value or a set of xed values. However, in a number of real-world cases, objective truth existence cannot be ensured and we can only identify single or multiple reliable facts from opinions. Dierent from traditional truth discovery task, we address this uncertainty and introduce the concept of trustworthy opinion of an entity, treat it as a random variable, and use its distribution to describe consistency or controversy, which is particularly dicult for data which can be numerically measured, i.e. quantitative information. In this study, we focus on the quantitative opinion, propose an uncertainty-aware approach called Kernel Density Estimation from Multiple Sources (KDEm) to estimate its probability distribution, and summarize trustworthy in-formation based on this distribution. Experiments indicate that KDEm not only has outstanding performance on the classical numeric truth discovery task, but also shows good performance on multi-modality detection and anomaly detection in the uncertain-opinion setting."

        "abstract": "We increasingly depend on the Internet for the rapid retrieval of information, but what it returns may be conflicting or inaccurate. Because there can be significant risk to acting upon bad information in uncertain domains (e.g., medical, intelligence), it is important to understand the factors that influence how we judge the credibility of information and determine its trustworthiness. We hypothesize that the information itself has unique qualities that can provide independent cues as to whether information can be trusted. These qualities are likely to become most salient to decision making when other information about the source (i.e., expertise) is vague or lacking. In the present study, we examined how a putative measure of information credibility (IC) influenced information-based decision-making. Subjects were tasked with finding the best answer to a series of general knowledge questions while given access to information from outside sources. Specifically, after generating an answer of their own, they received an alternative answer from either one or three sources and had to decide whether to stay with their answer or switch to an alternative. Good performance was incentivized by reward, however in one condition reward was based only on accuracy, and in another it was based on both accuracy and speed. The IC of these answers, including both the subject's response and the alternative(s) provided, was operationalized as the normative frequency with which that response (correct or incorrect) had been previously given across 6 previous, independent studies. Items with higher frequencies tended to have greater association with the question in the population, and thus, were expected to generate greater feelings of fluency during information evaluation in the current task. Using GLMM models with logit distributions, we found that the difference in IC between the subjects response and the alternative response significantly predicted whether subjects stayed with their own response or switched, supporting the predictive validity of our IC metric and the view that individuals evaluated the knowledge of others with respect to their own. Next, we examined the psychophysical properties of the models to calculate the point of equal probability for staying with or switching the answer. We found having more sources increased the tendency for subjects to switch to the alternative, whereas under time pressure individuals favored staying with their own answer."

Yet, despite the abundance of empirical findings showing that Need for Cognition (NC) and Need for Cognitive Closure (NCC) impact decision making, their effects have not been studied extensively in the context of complex social networks. To study this problem, we created an agent-based simulation model that operationalized components of the NC and NCC measures and examined how these influenced realistic problem-solving scenarios in which information was pushed to the agent and accumulated until a decision was made. Information was varied in quantity, quality and degree of corroboration from other sources. We found that a high level of NC (engagement with information) can lead to information overload in noisy environments, whereas NCC (decisiveness) can be useful in some scenarios, particularly if agents corroborate decisions with neighbors."

        "abstract": "To ensure the correctness of network analysis methods, the network (as the input) has to be a sufficiently accurate representation of the underlying data. However, when representing sequential data from complex systems, such as global shipping traffic or Web clickstream traffic as networks, conventional network representations that implicitly assume the Markov property (first-order dependency) can quickly become limiting. This assumption holds that, when movements are simulated on the network, the next movement depends only on the current node, discounting the fact that the movement may depend on several previous steps. However, we show that data derived from many complex systems can show up to fifth-order dependencies. In these cases, the oversimplifying assumption of the first-order network representation can lead to inaccurate network analysis results. To address this problem, we propose the higher-order network (HON) representation that can discover and embed variable orders of dependencies in a network representation. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation and analysis, we establish several desirable characteristics of HON, including accuracy, scalability, and direct compatibility with the existing suite of network analysis methods. We illustrate how HON can be applied to a broad variety of tasks, such as random walking, clustering, and ranking, and we demonstrate that, by using it as input, HON yields more accurate results without any modification to these tasks."

The information on the joint distribution of the sources available at the two sides is asymmetric, in that one user knows the true distribution, whereas the other user observes a different distribution. This paper considers the minimum worst-case zero-error codeword length under such asymmetric prior distributions. We investigate the cases for which reconciling the information mismatch is better or worse than not reconciling it, but instead using an encoding scheme that ensures zero-error with possibly increased communication rate. Our results indicate a reconciliation-communication tradeoff and that there exist cases for which partially reconciling the mismatched information is better than both perfect reconciliation and no reconciliation."

Using network modeling and data drawn from logs of social behavior inside the virtual world Second Life, we combine individual- and network-level theories into an integrated model of online social relationship formation. Results reveal that time spent online and the network pressure toward balance (individuals tending to form relationships with others who have relationships in common) predict the emergence of online relationship ties, while gender, age, proximity, homophily (the tendency of individuals to form relationships among people with similar traits), and preferential attachment are not significant predictors within the observed networks. We discuss these results in light of existing research on online social relationships and describe how digital data and network analytics enable novel insights about the emergence of online social relationships."

This model attempts to capture networks of people who innovate by merging ideas and who solve problems by piecing together solutions. Each person in a social network has a unique piece of a jigsaw puzzle. Acquainted people with compatible puzzle pieces merge their puzzle pieces. More generally, groups of people with merged puzzle pieces merge if the groups know one another and have a pair of compatible puzzle pieces. The social network solves the puzzle if it eventually merges all the puzzle pieces. For an Erd?sRnyi social network with nn vertices and edge probability pnpn, we define the critical value pc(n)pc(n) for a connected puzzle graph to be the pnpn for which the chance of solving the puzzle equals 1/21/2. We prove that for the nn-cycle (ring) puzzle, pc(n)=?(1/logn)pc(n)=?(1/log?n), and for an arbitrary connected puzzle graph with bounded maximum degree, pc(n)=O(1/logn)pc(n)=O(1/log?n) and ?(1/nb)?(1/nb) for any b>0b>0. Surprisingly, with probability tending to 1 as the network size increases to infinity, social networks with a power-law degree distribution cannot solve any bounded-degree puzzle. This model suggests a mechanism for recent empirical claims that innovation increases with social density, and it might begin to show what social networks stifle creativity and what networks collectively innovate."

It specifically explores the synergy between (i) inference techniques used for filling-in missing pieces and (ii) source selection techniques used to determine which pieces to retrieve in order to improve inference results. We focus on prediction in disaster scenarios, where disruptive trend changes occur. We first discuss our previous conference study that compared a set of prediction heuristics and developed a hybrid prediction algorithm. We then enhance the prediction scheme by considering algorithms for sensor selection that improve inference quality. Our proposed source selection and extrapolation algorithms are tested using data collected during the New York City crisis in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in November 2012. The evaluation results show that consistently good predictions are achieved. The work is notable for addressing the bi-modal nature of damage propagation in complex systems subjected to stress, where periods of calm are interspersed with periods of severe change. It is novel in offering a new solution to the problem that jointly leverages source selection and extrapolation components thereby improving the results."

        "abstract": "The problem of similarity learning is relevant to many data mining applications, such as recommender systems, classification, and retrieval. This problem is particularly challenging in the context of networks, which contain different aspects such as the topological structure, content, and user supervision. These different aspects need to be combined effectively, in order to create a holistic similarity function. In particular, while most similarity learning methods in networks such as SimRank utilize the topological structure, the user supervision and content are rarely considered. In this paper, a factorized similarity learning (FSL) is proposed to integrate the link, node content, and user supervision into a uniform framework. This is learned by using matrix factorization, and the final similarities are approximated by the span of low-rank matrices. The proposed framework is further extended to a noise-tolerant version by adopting a hinge loss alternatively. To facilitate efficient computation on large-scale data, a parallel extension is developed. Experiments are conducted on the DBLP and CoRA data sets. The results show that FSL is robust and efficient and outperforms the state of the art. The code for the learning algorithm used in our experiments is available at http://?www.?ifp.?illinois.?edu/?~chang87/?."

        "abstract": "The problem of node classification in networks is an important one in a wide variety of social networking domains. In many real applications such as product recommendations, the class of interest may be very rare. In such scenarios, it is often very difficult to learn the most relevant node classification characteristics, both because of the paucity of training data, and because of poor connectivity among rare class nodes in the network structure. Node classification methods crucially dependent upon structural homophily, and a lack of connectivity among rare class nodes can create significant challenges. However, many such social networks are content-rich, and the content-rich nature of such networks can be leveraged to compensate for the lack of structural connectivity among rare class nodes. While content-centric and semi-supervised methods have been used earlier in the context of paucity of labeled data, the rare class scenario has not been investigated in this context. In fact, we are not aware of any known classification method which is tailored towards rare class detection in networks. This paper will present a spectral approach for rare-class detection, which uses a distance-preserving transform, in order to combine the structural information in the network with the available content. We will show the advantage of this approach over traditional methods for collective classification."

This paper takes some key steps towards facilitating reasoning about quantities expressed in natural language. We investigate two different tasks of numerical reasoning. First, we consider Quantity Entailment, a new task formulated to understand the role of quantities in general textual inference tasks. Second, we consider the problem of automatically understanding and solving elementary school math word problems. In order to address these quantitative reasoning problems we first develop a computational approach which we show to successfully recognize and normalize textual expressions of quantities. We then use these capabilities to further develop algorithms to assist reasoning in the context of the aforementioned tasks."

Prior studies in teamwork have suggested that a good team member replacement should bring synergy to the team in terms of having both skill matching and structure matching. However, existing techniques either do not cover both aspects or consider the two aspects independently. In this work, we propose a novel problem formulation using the concept of graph kernels that takes into account the interaction of both skill and structure matching requirements. To tackle the computational challenges, we propose a family of fast algorithms by (a) designing effective pruning strategies, and (b) exploring the smoothness between the existing and the new team structures. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations and user studies on real world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency. Our algorithms (a) perform significantly better than the alternative choices in terms of both precision and recall and (b) scale sub-linearly."

(Agentbased simulation of the diffusion of warnings, 2010) which incorporates trust (weighted links) between actors, and allows actors to actively participate in the spreading process, specifically through the ability to query friends for additional information. This model captures how social agents transmit and act upon information more realistically as compared to the simpler threshold and cascade models. However, it is more difficult to analyze, in particular with respect to seeding strategies. We present efficient, scalable algorithms for determining good seed setsinitial nodes to inject with the information. Our general approach is to reduce our model to a class of simpler models for which provably good sets can be constructed. By tuning this class of simpler models, we obtain a good seed set for the original more complex model. We call this the projected greedy approach because a model is projected onto a class of simpler models where the greedy seed set selection is near-optimal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our seeding strategy on synthetic graphs as well as a realistic San Diego evacuation network constructed during the 2007 fires, and the DBLP network of collaborations."

        "abstract": "Social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) serves as a popular platform for online communication and information dissemination, where users can effectively share information such as their recent activities and plans. This kind of information is extremely valuable for building recommendation systems. For example, a user might wish to receive alerts whenever a concert takes place near his current location or when a party will be held in his neighborhood. However, such events may not be widespread across social networks, they have not received sufficient attention. Moreover, traditional event discovery and event extraction techniques trained from formal genres cannot be effectively adapted to this domain. In this paper, we present the first formal definition of social events, discuss the annotation challenges and release a benchmark for the research community. Further more, we propose two novel solutions for extracting elements from social events: (1) an unsupervised content segmentation framework to extract event phrases (2) utilize external knowledge bases to detect fine-grained event locations and unveil their background information. Experimental results convincingly demonstrate that our approach can accurately extract social events from social media."

        "abstract": "Digital technologies have created the potential for new forms of organizing among geographically dispersed individuals by connecting their ideas across the time and space in complex multiteam systems (MTSs). Realizing this potential requires novel forms of shared leadership structures to shepherd divergent and convergent thinking necessary to nurture innovation. While there is limited research on how space influences leadership and how the time influences leadership, there is virtually no theorizing on how space and time interact together to influence the emergence of shared leadership structures that facilitates innovation. A key contribution of this study is to utilize an agent-based model (ABM) that draws upon the research on leadership, networks, and innovation to specify generative mechanisms (or micro-processes) through which shared leadership structures emerge over space and time. The parameters in this model were estimated from empirical data. Results of virtual experiments (VE) yielded testable hypotheses suggesting that, over time, leadership capacity and between-team ties are negatively influenced by space. Furthermore, the computational model suggests that space increases the concentration of divergent leadership but decreases the concentration of convergent leadership. The study concludes by discussing the implications for the design of effective leadership structures to nurture innovation in MTSs."

Given a large graph, how can we find its most important structures, so that we can summarize it and easily visualize it? How can we measure the importance of a set of discovered subgraphs in a large graph? Starting with the observation that real graphs often consist of stars, bipartite cores, cliques, and chains, our main idea is to find the most succinct description of a graph in these vocabulary terms. To this end, we first mine candidate subgraphs using one or more graph partitioning algorithms. Next, we identify the optimal summarization using the minimum description length (MDL) principle, picking only those subgraphs from the candidates that together yield the best lossless compression of the graphor, equivalently, that most succinctly describe its adjacency matrix.Our contributions are threefold: (i) formulation: we provide a principled encoding scheme to identify the vocabulary type of a given subgraph for six structure types prevalent in real-world graphs, (ii) algorithm: we develop VoG, an efficient method to approximate the MDL-optimal summary of a given graph in terms of local graph structures, and (iii) applicability: we report an extensive empirical evaluation on multimillion-edge real graphs, including Flickr and the Notre Dame web graph."

We further demonstrate that opposite-gender interactions between two young individuals are much more frequent than those between young same-gender people, while the situation is reversed after around 35 years old. We also discover that while same-gender triadic social relationships are persistently maintained over a lifetime, the opposite-gender triadic circles are unstable upon entering into middle-age. Finally we demonstrate a greater than 80% potential predictability for inferring users gender and a 73% predictability for age from mobile communication behaviors."

        "abstract": "Trustworthiness is a field of research that seeks to estimate the credibility of information by using knowledge of the source of the information. The most interesting form of this problem is when different pieces of information share sources, and when there is conflicting information from different sources. This model can be naturally represented as a bipartite graph. In order to understand this data well, it is important to have several methods of exploring it. A good visualization can help to understand the problem in a way that no simple statistics can. This paper defines several desiderata for a ****good**** visualization and presents three different visualization methods for trustworthiness graphs.The first visualization method is simply a naive bipartite layout, which is infeasible in nearly all cases. The second method is a physics-based graph layout that reveals some interesting and important structure of the graph. The third method is an orthogonal approach based on the adjacency matrix representation of a graph, but with many improvements that give valuable insights into the structure of the trustworthiness graph.We present interactive web-based software for the third form of visualization."

        "abstract": "A widely used measure of scientific impact is citations. However, due to their power-law distribution, citations are fundamentally difficult to predict. Instead, to characterize scientific impact, we address two analogous questions asked by many scientific researchers: How will my h-index evolve over time, and which of my previously or newly published papers will contribute to it? To answer these questions, we perform two related tasks. First, we develop a model to predict authors future h-indices based on their current scientific impact. Second, we examine the factors that drive paperseither previously or newly publishedto increase their authors predicted future h-indices. By leveraging relevant factors, we can predict an authors h-index in five years with an R2 value of 0.92 and whether a previously (newly) published paper will contribute to this future h-index with an F1 score of 0.99 (0.77). We find that topical authority and publication venue are crucial to these effective predictions, while topic popularity is surprisingly inconsequential. Further, we develop an online tool that allows users to generate informed h-index predictions. Our work demonstrates the predictability of scientific impact, and can help researchers to effectively leverage their scholarly position of standing on the shoulders of giants."

Such data are complex if the actor-nesting is not mutually exclusive. We use affiliation networks to represent teams and individuals, with links representing team membership; social relations between individuals are represented using one-mode networks. We propose an extension of correspondence analysis to multiple levels, incorporating multiple relations and attributes, and demonstrate it with two illustrative examples.

        "abstract": "A cyber-physical system (CPS) integrates physical (i.e., sensor) devices with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a context-sensitive system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in real-world situations. The CPS has wide applications in scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance, and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is called mining lines in the sand. With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a designated area, the CPS is required to discover all trajectories (lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy, and (2) the intruders do not send out any identification information. The system needs to distinguish multiple intruders and track their movements. This study proposes a method called LiSM (Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover trajectories from untrustworthy sensor data. LiSM constructs a watching network from sensor data and computes the locations of intruder appearances based on the link information of the network. The system retrieves a cone model from the historical trajectories to track multiple intruders. Finally, the system validates the mining results and updates sensors reliability scores in a feedback process. In addition, LoRM (Line-on-the-Road Miner) is proposed for trajectory discovery on road networksmining lines on the roads. LoRM employs a filtering-and-refinement framework to reduce the distance computational overhead on road networks and uses a shortest-path-measure to track intruders. The proposed methods are evaluated with extensive experiments on big datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in trajectory mining tasks."

        "abstract": "Computer system monitoring generates huge amounts of logs that record the interaction of system entities. How to query such data to better understand system behaviors and identify potential system risks and malicious behaviors becomes a challenging task for system administrators due to the dynamics and heterogeneity of the data. System monitoring data are essentially heterogeneous temporal graphs with nodes being system entities and edges being their interactions over time. Given the complexity of such graphs, it becomes time-consuming for system administrators to manually formulate useful queries in order to examine abnormal activities, attacks, and vulnerabilities in computer systems.In this work, we investigate how to query temporal graphs and treat query formulation as a discriminative temporal graph pattern mining problem. We introduce TGMiner to mine discriminative patterns from system logs, and these patterns can be taken as templates for building more complex queries. TGMiner leverages temporal information in graphs to prune graph patterns that share similar growth trend without compromising pattern quality. Experimental results on real system data show that TGMiner is 6-32 times faster than baseline methods. The discovered patterns were verified by system experts; they achieved high precision (97%) and recall (91%)."

As more users join online social networks, the data available for analysis and forecast of human social and collective behavior grows at an incredible pace. The first part of this talk introduces an apparent paradox, where larger online social networks entail more user data but also less analytic and forecasting capabilities [7]. More specifically, the paradox applies to forecasting properties of network processes such as network cascades, showing that in some scenarios unbiased long term forecasting becomes increasingly inaccurate as the network grows but, paradoxically, short term forecasting -- such as the predictions in Cheng et al. [2] and Ribeiro et al. [7] -- improves with network size. We discuss the theoretic foundations of this paradox and its connections with known information theoretic measures such as Shannon capacity. We also discuss the implications of this paradox on the scalability of big data applications and show how information theory tools -- such as Fisher information [3,8] -- can be used to design more accurate and scalable methods for network analytics [6,8,10]. The second part of the talk focuses on how these results impact our ability to perform network analytics when network data is only available through crawlers and the complete network topology is unknown [1,4,5,9]."

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe Entity Linking (EL) task links entity mentions from an unstructured document to entities in a knowledge base. Although this problem is well-studied in news and social media, this problem has not received much attention in the life science domain. One outcome of tackling the EL problem in the life sciences domain is to enable scientists to build computational models of biological processes with more efficiency. However, simply applying a news-trained entity linker produces inadequate results.MethodsSince existing supervised approaches require a large amount of manually-labeled training data, which is currently unavailable for the life science domain, we propose a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to link entities from unstructured full texts of biomedical literature to 300 ontologies. The approach leverages the rich semantic information and structures in ontologies for similarity computation and entity ranking.ResultsWithout using any manual annotation, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised EL method (9% absolute gain in linking accuracy). Furthermore, the state-of-the-art supervised EL method requires 15,000 manually annotated entity mentions for training. These promising results establish a benchmark for the EL task in the life science domain. We also provide in depth analysis and discussion on both challenges and opportunities on automatic knowledge enrichment for scientific literature.ConclusionsIn this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to address the EL problem in a new domain. We show that our unsupervised approach is able to outperform a current state-of-the-art supervised approach that has been trained with a large amount of manually labeled data. Life science presents an underrepresented domain for applying EL techniques. By providing a small benchmark data set and identifying opportunities, we hope to stimulate discussions across natural language processing and bioinformatics and motivate others to develop techniques for this largely untapped domain."

        "abstract": "Information spreading in online social communities has attracted tremendous attention due to its utmost practical values in applications. Despite that several individual-level diffusion data have been investigated, we still lack the detailed understanding of the spreading pattern of information. Here, by comparing information flows and social links in a blog community, we find that the diffusion processes are induced by three different spreading mechanisms: social spreading, self-promotion and broadcast. Although numerous previous studies have employed epidemic spreading models to simulate information diffusion, we observe that such models fail to reproduce the realistic diffusion pattern. In respect to users behaviors, strikingly, we find that most users would stick to one specific diffusion mechanism. Moreover, our observations indicate that the social spreading is not only crucial for the structure of diffusion trees, but also capable of inducing more subsequent individuals to acquire the information. Our findings suggest new directions for modeling of information diffusion in social systems, and could inform design of efficient propagation strategies based on users behaviors."

Explosive percolation transitions exhibit an array of novel universality classes and supercritical behaviors including a stochastic sequence of discontinuous transitions, multiple giant components, and lack of self-averaging. Many mechanisms that give rise to explosive percolation have been discovered, including overtaking, correlated percolation, and evolution on hierarchical lattices. Many connections to real-world systems, ranging from social networks to nanotubes, have been identified and explosive percolation is an emerging paradigm for modeling these systems as well as the consequences of small interventions intended to delay phase transitions.

        "abstract": "Mining time series data has been a very active research area in the past decade, exactly because of its prevalence in many high-impact applications, ranging from environmental monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, computer network forensics, to smart buildings and many more. It has posed many fascinating research questions. Among others, three prominent challenges shared by a variety of real applications are (a) high-order; (b) contextual constraints and (c) temporal smoothness. The state-of-the-art mining algorithms are rich in addressing each of these challenges, but relatively short of comprehensiveness in attacking the coexistence of multiple or even all of these three challenges.In this paper, we propose a comprehensive method, FACETS, to simultaneously model all these three challenges. We formulate it as an optimization problem from a dynamic graphical model perspective. The key idea is to use tensor factorization to address multi-aspect challenges, and perform careful regularizations to attack both contextual and temporal challenges. Based on that, we propose an effective and scalable algorithm to solve the problem. Our experimental evaluations on three real datasets demonstrate that our method (1) outperforms its competitors in two common data mining tasks (imputation and prediction); and (2) enjoys a linear scalability w.r.t. the length of time series."

        "abstract": "Using data from a novel laboratory experiment on complex problem solving in which we varied the structure of 16-person networks, we investigate how an organizations network structure shapes the performance of problem-solving tasks. Problem solving, we argue, involves both exploration for information and exploration for solutions. Our results show that network clustering has opposite effects for these two important and complementary forms of exploration. Dense clustering encourages members of a network to generate more diverse information but discourages them from generating diverse theories; that is, clustering promotes exploration in information space but decreases exploration in solution space. Previous research, generally focusing on only one of those two spaces at a time, has produced an inconsistent understanding of the value of network clustering. By adopting an experimental platform on which information was measured separately from solutions, we bring disparate results under a single theoretical roof and clarify the effects of network clustering on problem-solving behavior and performance. The finding both provides a sharper tool for structuring organizations for knowledge work and reveals challenges inherent in manipulating network structure to enhance performance, as the communication structure that helps one determinant of successful problem solving may harm the other."

        "abstract": "Random walk with restart (RWR) is widely recognized as one of the most important node proximity measures for graphs, as it captures the holistic graph structure and is robust to noise in the graph. In this paper, we study a novel query based on the RWR measure, called the inbound top-k (Ink) query. Given a query node q and a number k, the Ink query aims at retrieving k nodes in the graph that have the largest weighted RWR scores to q. Ink queries can be highly useful for various applications such as traffic scheduling, disease treatment, and targeted advertising. Nevertheless, none of the existing RWR computation techniques can accurately and efficiently process the Ink query in large graphs. We propose two algorithms, namely Squeeze and Ripple, both of which can accurately answer the Ink query in a fast and incremental manner. To identify the top-k nodes, Squeeze iteratively performs matrix-vector multiplication and estimates the lower and upper bounds for all the nodes in the graph. Ripple employs a more aggressive strategy by only estimating the RWR scores for the nodes falling in the vicinity of q, the nodes outside the vicinity do not need to be evaluated because their RWR scores are propagated from the boundary of the vicinity and thus upper bounded. Ripple incrementally expands the vicinity until the top-k result set can be obtained. Our extensive experiments on real-life graph data sets show that Ink queries can retrieve interesting results, and the proposed algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art method."

        "abstract": "Integrating multiple graphs (or networks) has been shown to be a promising approach to improve the graph clustering accuracy. Various multi-view and multi-domain graph clustering methods have recently been developed to integrate multiple networks. In these methods, a network is treated as a view or domain.The key assumption is that there is a common clustering structure shared across all views (domains), and different views (domains) provide compatible and complementary information on this underlying clustering structure. However, in many emerging real-life applications, different networks have different data distributions, where the assumption that all networks share a single common clustering structure does not hold. In this paper, we propose a flexible and robust framework that allows multiple underlying clustering structures across different networks. Our method models the domain similarity as a network, which can be utilized to regularize the clustering structures in different networks. We refer to such a data model as a network of networks (NoN). We develop NoNClus, a novel method based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), to cluster an NoN. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis of NoNClus in terms of its correctness, convergence and complexity. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-life datasets show the effectiveness of our method."

        "abstract": "We investigate the emergence of extreme opinion trends in society by employing statistical physics modeling and analysis on polls that inquire about a wide range of issues such as religion, economics, politics, abortion, extramarital sex, books, movies, and electoral vote. The surveys lay out a clear indicator of the rise of extreme views. The precursor is a nonlinear relation between the fraction of individuals holding a certain extreme view and the fraction of individuals that includes also moderates, e.g., in politics, those who are very conservative versus moderate to very conservative ones. We propose an activation model of opinion dynamics with interaction rules based on the existence of individual stubbornness that mimics empirical observations. According to our modeling, the onset of nonlinearity can be associated to an abrupt bootstrap-percolation transition with cascades of extreme views through society. Therefore, it represents an early-warning signal to forecast the transition from moderate to extreme views. Moreover, by means of a phase diagram we can classify societies according to the percolative regime they belong to, in terms of critical fractions of extremists and peoples ties."

While most prior efforts focus on Twitter, the much fewer Facebook studies focus on the friendship graph or are limited by the amount of users or the duration of the study. In this work, we model Facebook user behavior: we analyze the wall activities of users focusing on identifying common patterns and surprising phenomena. We conduct an extensive study of roughly 7K users over three years during four month intervals each year. We propose PowerWall, a lesser known heavy-tailed distribution to fit our data. Our key results can be summarized in the following points. First, we find that many wall activities, including number of posts, number of likes, number of posts of type photo, etc., can be described by the PowerWall distribution. What is more surprising is that most of these distributions have similar slope, with a value close to 1! Second, we show how our patterns and metrics can help us spot surprising behaviors and anomalies. For example, we find a user posting every two days, exactly the same count of posts; another user posting at midnight, with no other activity before or after. Our work provides a solid step towards a systematic and quantitative wall-centric profiling of Facebook user activity."

Satisfying these requirements may become challenging when applications operate on a collection of dynamically loaded and evicted datasets, where data volume and distribution varies over time. In this paper we present Stark1, a system designed specif- ically for optimizing in-memory computations on dy- namic dataset collections. Stark enforces data co-locality across datasets to avoid unnecessary data replications and movements. Moreover, to accommodate the fluc- tuating data volume and skewed data distribution, Stark offers extendable partitioning to balance task execution time, reducing job makespan. Finally, Stark achieves bounded failure recovery latency by optimizing the data checkpointing strategy. We evaluate Stark on a 50-server cluster using a Wikipedia trace, an NYC taxi trace, and Twitter data. Results show that, Stark reduces the re- sponse time by 4X and improves system throughput by 6X compared to Spark."

        "abstract": "Pattern-based classification was originally proposed to improve the accuracy using selected frequent patterns, where many efforts were paid to prune a huge number of non-discriminative frequent patterns. On the other hand, tree-based models have shown strong abilities on many classification tasks since they can easily build high-order interactions between different features and also handle both numerical and categorical features as well as high dimensional features. By taking the advantage of both modeling methodologies, we propose a natural and effective way to resolve pattern-based classification by adopting discriminative patterns which are the prefix paths from root to nodes in tree-based models (e.g., random forest). Moreover, we further compress the number of discriminative patterns by selecting the most effective pattern combinations that fit into a generalized linear model. As a result, our discriminative pattern-based classification framework (DPClass) could perform as good as previous state-of-theart algorithms, provide great interpretability by utilizing only very limited number of discriminative patterns, and predict new data extremely fast. More specifically, in our experiments, DPClass could gain even better accuracy by only using top-20 discriminative patterns. The framework so generated is very concise and highly explanatory to human experts."

        "abstract": "Consecutive pattern mining aiming at finding sequential patterns substrings, is a special case of frequent pattern mining and has been played a crucial role in many real world applications, especially in biological sequence analysis, time series analysis, and network log mining. Approximations, including insertions, deletions, and substitutions, between strings are widely used in biological sequence comparisons. However, most existing string pattern mining methods only consider hamming distance without insertions/deletions (indels). Little attention has been paid to the general approximate consecutive frequent pattern mining under edit distance, potentially due to the high computational complexity, particularly on DNA sequences with billions of base pairs. In this paper, we introduce an efficient solution to this problem. We first formulate the Maximal Approximate Consecutive Frequent Pattern Mining (MACFP) problem that identifies substring patterns under edit distance in a long query sequence. Then, we propose a novel algorithm with linear time complexity to check whether the support of a substring pattern is above a predefined threshold in the query sequence, thus greatly reducing the computational complexity of MACFP. With this fast decision algorithm, we can efficiently solve the original pattern discovery problem with several indexing and searching techniques. Comprehensive experiments on sequence pattern analysis and a study on cancer genomics application demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm, compared to several existing methods."

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, providing a comprehensive landscape of protein interacting patterns, enable us to explore biological processes and cellular components at multiple resolutions. For a biological process, a number of proteins need to work together to perform the job. Proteins densely interact with each other, forming large molecular machines or cellular building blocks. Identification of such densely interconnected clusters or protein complexes from PPI networks enables us to obtain a better understanding of the hierarchy and organization of biological processes and celluar compoenents. Most existing methods apply efficient graph clustering algorithms on PPI networks, often failing to detect possible densely connected subgraphs and overlapped subgraphs. Besides clusteringbased methods, dense subgraph enumeration methods have also been used, which aim to find all densely connected protein sets. However, such methods are not practically tractable even on a small yeast PPI network, due to high computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel approximate algorithm to efficiently enumerate putative protein complexes from biological networks. The key insight of our algorithm is that we do not need to enumerate all dense subgraphs. Instead we only need to find a small subset of subgraphs that cover as many proteins as possible, meanwhile have minimal overlap among themselves. The problem is formulated as finding a diverse set of dense subgraphs, where we develop highly effective pruning techniques to guarantee efficiency. To handle large networks, we take a divide-and-conquer approach to speed up the algorithm in a distributed manner. By comparing with existing clustering and dense subgraph-based algorithms on several human and yeast PPI networks, we demonstrate that our method can detect more putative protein complexes and achieves better prediction accuracy."

The inability of this dyadic approach to operationalize higher order structures like groups, communities, and collaborations has long been noted. However, attempts to apply alternative group-based approaches to network analysis have remained largely within the theoretical domain, for instance, using algebraic topology, in particular the simplicial complex. Our research attempts to apply these models to empirical phenomena. In this presentation, we focus on laboratory experiments using simplicial complexes in both the design and analysis of the study. We show how simplicial complexes can be operationalized in a laboratory setting and how network effectiveness and structure can be observed within the simplicial framework."

With high-quality onboard cameras, these devices are capable of collecting large volumes of visual information.  Motivated by the observation that processing this video on the mobile device can enable many new applications, we explore the feasibility of running very deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for video processing tasks on an emerging class of mobile platforms with embedded GPUs. We find that the memory available in these mobile GPUs is significantly less than necessary to execute very deep CNNs. We then quantify the performance of several deep CNN-specific memory management techniques, some of which leverage the observation that these CNNs have a small number of layers that require most of the memory. We find that a particularly novel approach that offloads these bottleneck layers to the mobile device's CPU and pipelines frame processing is a promising approach that does not impact the accuracy of these tasks. We conclude by arguing that such techniques will likely be necessary for the foreseeable future despite technological improvements."

        "abstract": "Text classification is an important problem with many applications. Traditional approaches represent text as a bagof-words and build classifiers based on this representation. Rather than words, entity phrases, the relations between the entities, as well as the types of the entities and relations carry much more information to represent the texts. This paper presents a novel text as network classification framework, which introduces 1) a structured and typed heterogeneous information networks (HINs) representation of texts, and 2) a meta-path based approach to link texts. We show that with the new representation and links of texts, the structured and typed information of entities and relations can be incorporated into kernels. Particularly, we develop both simple linear kernel and indefinite kernel based on metapaths in the HIN representation of texts, where we call them HIN-kernels. Using Freebase, a well-known world knowledge base, to construct HIN for texts, our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the indefinite HIN-kernel based on weighted meta-paths outperforms the state-of-theart methods and other HIN-kernels."

Therefore, there has been increasing research effort on how to automatically detect newsworthy and otherwise useful information on these platforms.  \n\nIn this paper, we present two novel algorithmic approaches---content-similarity computation and graph analysis---to automatically capture main differences in newsworthy content between microblogs and traditional news media. \n\nFor the content-similarity algorithm, we discuss why it is difficult to capture such unique information using traditional text-based search mechanisms.  We performed an experiment to evaluate the content-similarity algorithm using a corpus of 35 million topic-specific Twitter messages and 6,112 New York Times articles on a variety of topics.  This is followed by an online user study (N=200) to evaluate how users assess the content recommended by the algorithm.  The results show significant differences in user perception of newsworthiness and uniqueness of the content returned by our algorithm.  \n\nSecondly, we investigate a method for identifying unique content in microblogs by harnessing network structure of the information propagation graphs. In this approach, we study how these two types of information differ from each other in terms of topic and dissemination behavior in the network. The results show that the majority of subgraphs in the traditional group have long retweet chains and exhibit a giant component surrounded by a number of small components, unique contents typically propagate from a dominating node with only a few multi-hop retweet chains observed. Furthermore, results from LDA and BPR algorithms indicate that strong and dense topic associations between users are frequently observed in the graphs of the traditional group, but not in the unique group.\n"

        "abstract": "Within operational environments decisions must be made quickly based on the information available. Identifying an appropriate knowledge base and accurately formulating a search query are critical tasks for decision-making effectiveness in dynamic situations. The spreading of graph data management tools to access large graph databases is a rapidly emerging research area of potential benefit to the intelligence community. A graph representation provides a natural way of modeling data in a wide variety of domains. Graph structures use nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. This research investigates the advantages of information search by graph query initiated by the analyst and interactively refined within the contextual dimensions of the answer space toward a solution. The paper introduces SLQ, a user-friendly graph querying system enabling the visual formulation of schemaless and structureless graph queries. SLQ is demonstrated with an intelligence analyst information search scenario focused on identifying individuals responsible for manufacturing a mosquito-hosted deadly virus. The scenario highlights the interactive construction of graph queries without prior training in complex query languages or graph databases, intuitive navigation through the problem space, and visualization of results in graphical format"

        "abstract": "Traditionally network science has focused on static networks, whose links offer permanent connections between its nodes. Yet, it is increasingly recognized that most natural and social systems are best described as temporal networks, acknowledging that their links exist only intermittently. For example, within a cell, the links of the metabolic charts correspond to brief chemical reactions; in social networks friendship links are inferred from face-to-face or digital communications of short duration. Such temporality has profound effects on\nmost dynamical processes taking place on networks, slowing down synchronization and the diffusion of innovative information6, impeding exploration and navigation, and raising barriers to accessibility. Given the many disadvantages of temporality, we must ask: Why does nature choose repeatedly such temporal networks? Here we demonstrate a crucial advantage of temporality: a significant, across-the-board enhancement of our ability to control them. Control, an ability to drive a system with input signals to any desired final state in finite time, is essential for the operation of most real systems. Controllability normally requires continuous paths, capable of carrying the input signals to the rest of the network. While in static networks such signal-carrying paths are permanently available, in temporal systems complete instantaneous paths between the inputs and the rest of the nodes are not guaranteed, potentially degrading our ability to control a system. We develop an analytical framework to explore the control properties of temporal networks, arriving to the counterintuitive conclusion that temporal networks, compared to their static (i.e. aggregated) counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and the control trajectories, through which the system reaches its final states, are significantly\nmore compact than those charactering their static counterparts. The combination of analytical, numerical and empirical results demonstrate that temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks, significantly enhancing our ability to control them."

With high-quality onboard cameras, these devices are capable of collecting large volumes of visual information. Motivated by the observation that processing this video on the mobile device can enable many new applications,  we explore the feasibility of running very deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for video processing  tasks  on  an  emerging  class  of  mobile  platforms  with embedded GPUs.  We find that the memory available in these mobile GPUs is significantly less than necessary to execute very deep CNNs.  We then quantify the performance of several deep CNN-specific memory management techniques, some of which leverage the observation that these CNNs have a small number of layers that require most of the memory.  We find that a particularly novel approach that offloads these bottleneck layers to the mobile devices CPU and pipelines frame processing is a promising approach that does not impact the accuracy of these tasks. We conclude by arguing that such techniques will likely be necessary for the forseeable future despite technological improvements."

        "abstract": "Recent research in the subfield of statistical relational learning has produced a number of methods to learn models from large-scale network data. While these methods have been shown to significantly improve predictions by exploiting relational dependencies, they have been developed based on the unrealistic assumption of full access to the data.\nIn practice, most methods are applied to sampled data, more specifically partial network crawls. There are a number of reasons that warrant the use of sampled networks for learning, including limited access to data, limited resources, and privacy concerns. Unfortunately, partial network crawls are unlikely to be representative of the full network due to transient properties of local subgraphs. This will not only result in biased estimates of model parameters, but with- out access to the full network the methods are unable to gauge the accuracy of the parameter estimates effectively. In this work we introduce RelationalTours, the first crawl- based sampling technique that can accurately learn relational models via partial network crawls. The key insight of RelationalTours is the use of renewal epochs of random walk tours to perform unbiased estimation and adaptive MCMC sampling to reduce variance. RelationalTours produces un- biased estimates of the relational dependencies in the entire network even if we start crawling from an unrepresentative neighborhood. We can also assess the uncertainty of our parameter estimates during crawling, which supports hypothesis testing and adaptive sample size determination. In our experiments, we show that crawling just 0.5% of the nodes in a large attributed social network is sufficient to accurately learn network-wide conditional probability distributions."

        "abstract": "A sandpile diffusion process (introduced by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld) operates on the nodes of a network, which have fixed capacity (typically equal to node degree) to hold grains of sand. A node receives a grain of sand (from an external source or a toppling neighbor) and topples if the current load equals or exceeds its capacity. Toppling results in shedding one grain to each of the neighbors and potentially results in cascades through the network, which stabilize only when there are no more nodes to topple. A subset of nodes in the network are sinks which absorb the grains and never topple. Sandpiles can model cascading behaviors such as load shedding in electrical power grids and other interdependent networks.\n\nMost research on sandpiles has focused on characterizing the properties of a cascade resulting from toppling events, in particular, their size distributions, but not the properties of the resultant configuration or the effect of specific initial configurations on cascade dynamics.  We report two novel findings regarding such properties of sandpile configurations in this abstract. We first investigate methods and metrics to characterize the grain distribution across the network after a sandpile stabilizes. We also investigate the effect of the initial grain distribution on avalanche sizes in a directed sandpile model on a 2D directed square lattice, where each node has in-degree and out-degree two (except boundaries)."

        "abstract": "Modeling information that resides on vertices of large graphs is a key problem in several real-life applications, ranging from social networks to the Internet-of-things. Signal Processing on Graphs and, in particular, graph wavelets can exploit the intrinsic smoothness of these datasets in order to represent them in a both compact and accurate manner. However, how to discover wavelet bases that capture the geometry of the data with respect to the signal as well as the graph structure remains an open question. In this paper, we study the problem of computing graph wavelet bases via sparse cuts in order to produce low-dimensional encodings of data-driven bases. This problem is connected to known hard problems in graph theory (e.g. multiway cuts) and thus requires an efficient heuristic. We formulate the basis discovery task as a relaxation of a vector optimization problem, which leads to an elegant solution as a regularized eigenvalue computation. Moreover, we propose several strategies in order to scale our algorithm to large graphs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively encode both the graph structure and signal, producing compressed and accurate representations for vertex values in a wide range of datasets (e.g. sensor and gene networks) and outperforming the best baseline by up to 8 times."

        "abstract": "Cumulative advantage (CA) refers to the notion that accumulated resources foster the accumulation of further resources in competitions, a phenomenon that has been empirically observed in various contexts. The oldest and arguably simplest mathematical model that embodies this general principle is the Polya urn process, which finds applications in a myriad of problems. The original model captures the dynamics of competitions between two equally fit agents under linear CA effects, which can be readily generalized to incorporate different fitnesses and nonlinear CA effects. We study two statistics of competitions under the generalized model, namely duration (i.e., time of the last tie) and intensity (i.e., number of ties). We give rigorous mathematical characterizations of the tail distributions of both duration and intensity under the various regimes for fitness and nonlinearity, which reveal very interesting behaviors. For example, fitness superiority induces much shorter competitions in the sublinear regime while much longer competitions in the superlinear regime. Our findings can shed light on the application of Polya urn processes in more general contexts where fitness and nonlinearity may be present."

        "abstract": "We present a network influence game that models players strategically seeding the opinions of nodes embedded in a social net- work. A social learning dynamic, whereby nodes repeatedly update their opinions to resemble those of their neighbors, spreads the seeded opinions through the network. After a fixed period of time, the dynamic halts and each players utility is determined by the relative strength of the opinions held by each node in the network vis-a-vis the other players. We show that the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium cannot be guaranteed in general. However, if the dynamics are allowed to progress for a sufficient amount of time so that a consensus among all of the nodes is obtained, then the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium can be guaranteed. The computational complexity of finding a pure strategy best response is shown to be NP-complete, but can be efficiently approximated to within a (1  1/e) factor of optimal by a simple greedy algorithm."

        "abstract": "The paradigm of layered networks is used to describe many real-world systems  from biological networks, to social organizations and transportation systems. While recently there has been much progress in understanding the general properties of multilayer networks, our understanding of how to control such systems remains limited. One fundamental aspect that makes this endeavor challenging is that each layer can operate at a different timescale, thus we cannot directly apply standard ideas from structural control theory of individual networks. Here we address the problem of controlling multilayer and multi-timescale networks in the practically relevant case when the control signal is applied to the nodes of one layer. We develop a theory based on disjoint path covers to determine the minimum number of inputs (Ni) necessary for full control. Focusing on two-layer systems, we show that if both layers operate on the same timescale then the network structure of both layers equally affect controllability. In the presence of timescale separation, controllability is enhanced if the controller interacts with the faster layer: Ni decreases as the timescale difference increases up to a critical timescale difference, above which further increase does not effect controllability. We show that the critical value can be predicted by a combination of control properties of the system without timescale separation. In contrast, control becomes increasingly difficult if the controller interacts with the layer operating on the slower timescale and increasing timescale separation leads to increased Ni, again up to a critical value. This critical value is largely determined by the longest path in the faster layer that does not involve cycles."

        "abstract": "A large amount of research in recommender systems focuses on algorithmic accuracy and optimization of ranking metrics. However, recent work has highlighted the importance of other aspects of the recommendation process, including explanation, transparency, control and user experience in general. Building on these aspects, this paper introduces \\\\emph{MoodPlay}, a hybrid music-band recommender system which integrates content and mood-based filtering in a novel interactive interface, allowing the user to explore the items on a latent space visualization. We show how \\\\emph{MoodPlay} allows the user to explore a music collection by latent affective dimensions, and we explain how to integrate user input at recommendation time with predictions based on a pre-existing profile. We describe system architecture, design and interactive features followed by a use-case evaluation of the system.  Results of a user study (N=240) are discussed, with four conditions being evaluated with varying degrees of visualization, interaction and control. Results of this study show that visualization and interaction in a latent space improve acceptance and understanding of both metadata and item recommendations. However, too much of either can result in cognitive overload and a negative impact on user experience. The paper concludes with a discussion of the observed impact of visual and interactive features and associated cognitive limitations that aims to inform design of future interactive recommendation systems.

        "abstract": "In many real-world applications that support item recommendation, search functionality is frequently offered to users in parallel.  In this setup, users must make active choices between query-driven search and personalized, profile-based recommendations.  We conducted a study (N=526) on users of Movie Miner --a movie discovery tool that supports search and recommendation in parallel.   Analysis of user cognitive metrics, observed behavior, task outcomes, and user experience metrics produced several key findings that we believe are important for the design of recommender systems:  1) user experience with such systems may be measured along one single scale rather than a collection of individual factors (understandability, control, usefulness, trust, etc.), 2) users that understand ``movie data'' and exhibit higher cognitive attention display different usage patterns than their peers, 3) control over, and explanations from the recommender improved task outcomes, 4) increased effectiveness of recommendations improved user experience, and 5) interacting with a recommender can cause a perceptual bias, but this can be avoided by helping the user understand the system via interactive feedback and explanations."

However, reviewers can have tastes that vary based on personal, demographic or cultural background. Prior work has discussed methods for generating attribute-based explanations for item ratings on cosmetic products, based on associated text-based reviews. This paper focuses on evaluating explanation interfaces for product reviews and related attributes. We present the results of a cross-cultural user study that evaluates five associated explanation interfaces for cosmetic product reviews across groups of participants from three different cultural backgrounds. We applied a 3 by 2 within subjects experimental design in a user study (N=150) to evaluate effects of UI design and personalization on a range of user experience metrics in a cosmetics shopping scenario.  Results of the study show that 1) Korean and Japanese speakers chose the most complex UI more often than English speakers. 2) older participants also preferred more options in cosmetic product selection, regardless of cultural background. 3) personalization of product ratings did not show an effect on user experience. 4) Attribute-based explanations were preferred over star-ratings for all three cultures. 5) Rating propensity evaluation showed that Japanese provided significantly higher ratings than Korean or English participants, and that Females provided higher ratings than Males, regardless of background.

        "abstract": "We investigated human understanding of different network visualizations in a large-scale online experiment. Three types of network visualizations were examined: node-link and two different sorting variants of matrix representations on a constructed social network of either 20 or 50 nodes. Participant understanding was assessed using task time and accuracy metrics on questions that were derived from an established task taxonomy.  The sample size in our experiment was more than a magnitude of order larger (\\\\textit{N} = 600) than in previous research, leading to high statistical power and thus more precise estimation of detailed effects.  Specifically, high statistical power allowed us to consider modern interaction capabilities (e.g. mouse-over highlighting and pen-stroke annotations) as part of the evaluated visualizations, and to evaluate overall learning rates as well as ambient (implicit) learning. Findings indicate that participant understanding was best for the node-link visualization, with higher accuracy and faster task times than the two matrix visualizations. However, this performance advantage for node-link over matrix was attenuated in the larger (50-node) network. Analysis of participant learning indicated a large initial difference in task time between the node-link and matrix visualizations, with matrix performance steadily approaching that of the node-link visualization over the course of the experiment. We also collected information on the participants' mouse movements and annotations and we report some exploratory analyses of this data.  This research is fully reproducible as the web-based study module and results are made publicly available (submitted as supplemental material for double-blind review"

        "abstract": "Current systems of fine-grained entity typing use distant supervision in conjunction with existing knowledge bases to assign categories (type labels) to entity mentions. However, the type labels so obtained from knowledge bases are often noisy (i.e., incorrect for the entity mentions local context). We define a new task, Label Noise Reduction in Entity Typing (LNR), to be the automatic identification of correct type labels (type-paths) for training examples, given the set of candidate type labels obtained by distant supervision with a given type hierarchy. The unknown type labels for individual entity mentions and the semantic similarity between entity types pose unique challenges for solving the LNR task. We propose a general framework, called PLE, to jointly embed entity mentions, text features and entity types into the same low-dimensional space where, in that space, objects whose types are semantically close have similar representations. Then we estimate the type-path for each training example in a top-down manner using the learned embeddings. We formulate a global objective for learning the embeddings from text corpora and knowledge bases, which adopts a novel margin-based loss that is robust to noisy labels and faithfully models type correlation derived from knowledge bases. Our experiments on three public typing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PLE, with an average of 25% improvement in accuracy compared to next best method."

To turn such massive unstructured text data into actionable knowledge, one of the grand challenges is to gain an understanding of entities and the relationships between them. In this tutorial, we introduce data-driven methods to recognize typed entities of interest in different kinds of text corpora (especially in massive, domain-specific text corpora). These methods can automatically identify token spans as entity mentions in text and label their types (e.g., people, product, food) in a scalable way. We demonstrate on real datasets including news articles and yelp reviews how these typed entities aid in knowledge discovery and management."

The inability of this dyadic approach to operationalize higher order structures like groups, communities, and collaborations has long been noted [1,2]. However, attempts to apply alternative group-based approaches to network analysis have remained largely within the theoretical domain, for instance, using algebraic topology [3,4], in particular the simplicial complex. Our research attempts to apply these models to empirical phenomena. In this presentation, we focus on laboratory experiments using simplicial complexes in both the design and analysis of the study. We show how simplicial complexes can be operationalized in a laboratory setting and how network effectiveness and structure can be observed within the simplicial framework."

In both instances, we utilized the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer to generate scores for each pair of individuals. These scores rated the degree to which the communication conveyed various tones, including anger, cheerfulness, and analytic. We then used ERGM analysis to test composite structural and semantic hypotheses.

        "abstract": "Military teams often function under conditions of high uncertainty and equivocality.  They must make sense of their situation and establish some degree of confidence in their ability to take actions that address the challenges.  They need to establish an epistemic anchor that supports situation awareness and decisive action in dynamic environments.  Timely and accurate information is one important factor that helps a team anchor itself in the face of the booming, buzzing confusion it faces in the theater of action.  Trustworthiness of information networks is thus a primary anchoring factor for teams facing new, unfamiliar, or puzzling situations.\nEpistemic anchoring is challenging when a team receives inaccurate information.  Team members must not only develop accurate situational awareness, they must find a way to reconcile the information from a presumably trusted and authoritative source with what they are seeing and experiencing.   Exactly how they do this is an important subject, because it mediates the impact of information networks on human performance.  The most functional response (from the perspective of those designing and maintaining the information network) would be for the team to use situational cues as its primary reference point, conclude that the inaccurate information is simply an anomaly, and continue to presume that future information will be accurate.  It is, however, possible that the team will conclude that the information network is unreliable and stop using or attending to it.  It is also possible that the team will become so disoriented due to loss of anchoring that it wastes valuable time, puts itself, in danger, and fails in its mission.  This study is a preliminary inquiry into the impacts of inaccuracy on team performance in multi-team systems (MTS), teams of teams, and the factors that affect a teams ability to cope with inaccurate information.\nOne important factor should be the degree to which epistemic anchoring has been previously established.   Teams which receive accurate information as they enter a given environment should be better able to navigate the environment effectively and in so doing establishing a degree of epistemic anchoring in the situation.  Given this foundation, when they subsequently receive inaccurate information they are more likely to simply dismiss it as anomalous and take decisive actions to construct a workable picture of the situation.  \nOn the other hand, teams which receive inaccurate information as they enter an environment are less able to establish epistemic anchoring and will have more difficulty coping with uncertainty.  These teams may develop distrust in the information source, second guess the source and their own actions, and be less decisive and systematic in their actions.\nAn important influence on how the MTS copes with inaccurate information is the socio-cognitive network through which the teams communicate with each other.  This network, configured according to roles and norms in the MTS, channels information processing.  A hierarchical network in which a few key members manage information flow and processing should facilitate the reconciliation process because these key members can make the calls for the team and restore a sense of epistemic anchoring.  In the face of uncertainty and epistemic challenges, the teams can rely to a certain extent on the leaders interpretations and commands, which may help them establish a strategy for managing uncertainty.  It is also possible, however, that a flat network structure, in which members can freely exchange information and debate interpretations, would enable effective reconciliation.  This is a question that the experiment puts to an initial test.\nA second factor that would be expected to influence reconciliation and MTS performance are microlevel coordination processes within and between teams.  These are likely to be influenced by the socio-cognitive network structure, but members of teams have a degree of latitude in how they interact with each other and the particular patterns of interaction they perform (out a very large repertoire of possible patterns) should influence how well teams cope with their immediate situation.  These localized action cycles are the means through which teams perform their work and so influence team and MTS effectiveness.  They also may contribute to or detract from a teams sense of epistemic anchoring and over the long run play a major role in establishing anchoring.\n"

It preserves the best features of the base SpeakEasy algorithm with the enhanced scalability of the parallel solution. The ability to identify robust communities is rooted in combining top-down and bottom-up approaches with the Speaker-listener Label Propagation (SLPA) process and performing multiple runs of consensus clustering. Maintaining global label count required by this solution was the main new challenge for parallelization that we addressed by allowing loose (delayed) coordination of label count updates among processors. Designed with the scalability in mind, Parallel SpeakEasy follows the message passing paradigm to provide efficient community detection solution for a variety of hardware architectures, both shared memory and distributed-memory."

We create a communication activity network implied by call and text data, and a friendship network based on surveys. Both networks are limited to students participating in the NetSense surveys. We aim at finding student traits and activities on which agreements correlate well with formation and persistence of links while disagreements is highly correlated with non-existence or dissolution of links in the two social networks that we created. Using statistical analysis and machine learning, we observe several traits and activities displaying such correlations, thus being of potential use to predict social network evolution."

After generating their own response to a question and rating it, participants were shown one alternative (Study One) or three alternatives (Study Two) generated by previous players. They then decided whether to trust this new information over their existing choice. While metacognitive factors and information quality predicted trust in new information for both studies, behavioral inhibition only predicted informational-based trust when there was one alternative, while motivational drive and personal fear in invalidity predicted informational-based trust when there were three alternatives."

        "abstract": "When seeking answers to questions about general knowledge (e.g., information about authors, geographical locations) we often turn to the internet, with peer-to-peer information sites becoming increasingly popular resources. When faced with the choice of answers that these resources often provide, what factors influence us to trust and adopt this information as ground truth? For the present study, we developed the Baruch Information Trust Task (BITT) to examine how contextual factors pertaining to source information quality and quantity work alongside individual difference factors, including social beliefs (e.g., general trust, collectivism/ individualism) and metacognition for ones own knowledge, to separately and interactively influence information-based trust in a quasi-social environment. The BITT challenged participants to answer a series of difficult general knowledge questions that would potentially require assistance from outside sources in order to achieve rewards that were contingent on high accuracy. Participants first generated their own answer and rated their confidence that it was correct, then were presented with an answer from one other player (Study 1) or three other players (Study 2). Trust was operationalized as the likelihood of switching to another players answer, regardless of objective accuracy. Sources were deliberately made independent (i.e., not repeated), and anonymous (e.g., Player #213) to allow focus on the influence of the information itself and the trust biases of the individual. Question difficulty and population-level fluency of alternative answers, which serves to represent the information credibility (IC) of the answer, were controlled through use of the Baruch Normed Knowledge Database (BNKD). Analyzing the data using hierarchical logistic regression, we found, not surprisingly, that switching occurred more often in both studies when the subjects own answer was either incorrect and/or perceived to be low in quality compared to the alternatives (i.e., low confidence, lower IC). However, when multiple responses were provided (Study 2), social factors became influential as well. Subjects who cared more about being a group member (Horizontal Collectivism and Individualism) were more likely to be swayed from their high confidence initial response to a response from the alternatives. Cohesion amongst the alternatives was also influential in that subjects were overall more likely to switch when all three alternatives provided were similar in credibility (i.e., IC) than when they varied. Finally, individuals who were generally more trusting of others, in that they did not think that others would take advantage of them, were more likely to switch their answers an alternative answer, regardless of the information quality of either their answer or the alternatives from outside sources. Interestingly, this trust pattern was reversed when only one alternative was provided (Study 1). Taken together, these results demonstrate how social beliefs influence the propensity to accept the knowledge of others, especially in richer information environments, and even when there are few social cues about the expertise of these sources. Social media is a platform where information quantity exponentially increases often to the preclusion of increases in information quality, making it important to understand the factors that make the information from outside sources more or less compelling.

Alice and Bob have no direct links and wish to exchange their sources with fidelity via an intermediary, Ryan. Ryan also has an individual source and seeks to communicate it to Alice and Bob. We develop inner and outer bounds for the optimal rate-distortion region of this problem, which coincide in certain lossless cases, e.g., when the sources of Alice and Bob are conditionally independent given the source of Ryan or when two of the sources are functions of the third one. The bounds heavily make use of Wyner-Ziv and Berger-Tung coding and often rely on linear network coding. Our results highlight the dual role of the relaying source, which, on one hand, facilitates compression rate savings for the other two sources by helping as side information, and on the other hand, requires additional rate for its own description."

An upper bound is derived on the subset rate-distortion function in terms of the subset mutual information optimized over the set of conditional distributions that satisfy the expected distortion constraint with respect to the subset-typical distribution and over the set of certain auxiliary subsets. By proving a strong converse result, this upper bound is shown to be tight for a class of symmetric subsets. As illustrated in our numerical examples, more often than not, one achieves a gain in the fundamental limit, in that the optimal lossy compression rate for the subset can be strictly smaller than the rate-distortion function of the source, although exceptions can also be constructed."

        "abstract": "We study the problem of network topology design within a sequence of policy-compliant topologies as a game\nbetween a designer and an adversary. At any time instant, the designer aims to operate the network in an optimal\ntopology within this policy compliant sequence with respect to a desired network property. Simultaneously, the\nadversary counters the designer trying to force operation in a suboptimal topology. Specifically, if the designer and\nthe attacker choose the same link in the current topology to defend/grow and attack, respectively, then the latter is\nthwarted. However, if the defender does not correctly guess where the attacker is going to attack, and hence acts\nelsewhere, the topology reverts to the best policy-compliant configuration after a successful attack. We show the\nexistence of various mixed strategy equilibria in this game and systematically study its structural properties. We\nstudy the effect of parameters, such as probability of a successful attack, and characterize the steady state behavior\nof the underlying Markov chain. While the intuitive adversarial strategy here is to attack links appearing early in\nthe topology sequence, the Nash Equilibrium strategy is for the designer to defend the earlier links and for the\nadversary to attack the later links. We validate these properties through two use cases with example sets of network\ntopologies. Next, we consider a multi-stage framework where the designer is not only interested in the instantaneous\nnetwork property costs but a discounted sum of costs over many time instances. We establish structural properties\nof the equilibrium strategies in the multi-stage setting, and also demonstrate that applying algorithms based on\nthe Q-Learning and Rollout methods can result in significant benefits for the designer compared with strategies\nresulting from a one-shot based game."

Upon receiving a query, the expert network is tasked to route this query to experts with sufficient expertise in a timely and reliable manner. However, the efficiency of query answering depends on the underlying query routing protocol being used. Among all possible query routing protocols, decentralized search, operating purely on each expert's local information without any network global knowledge, represents the most basic and scalable routing protocol. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding on the efficiency of decentralized search in different expert networks. In this regard, we establish a generic model that can abstract diversified social and structural attributes in various expert networks into a common framework, thus applicable to a wide range of network scenarios. On top of such generic network model, we then study decentralized search by quantifying its performance under a variety of network parameters. Our key findings reveal the existence of network conditions, under which decentralized search can achieve significantly short query routing paths (i.e., between O(log n) and O(log^2 n) hops, n: total number of experts in the network). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying fundamental behaviors of decentralized search without relying on strict underlying network structures in expert networks. Experiments in both synthetic and real expert networks confirm the efficacy of the developed performance bounds in understanding and reasoning the network performance."

        "abstract": "Expert networks are formed by a group of expert-profes\\\\-sionals with different specialties to collaboratively resolve specific queries posted to the network. In such networks, when a query reaches an expert who does not have sufficient expertise, this query needs to be routed to other experts for further processing until it is completely solved; therefore, query answering efficiency is sensitive to the underlying query routing mechanism being used. Among all possible query routing mechanisms, decentralized search, operating purely on each expert's local information without any knowledge of network global structure, represents the most basic and scalable routing mechanism, which is applicable to any network scenarios even in dynamic networks. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the efficiency of decentralized search in expert networks.

Our key findings reveal the existence of network conditions, under which decentralized search can achieve significantly short query routing paths (i.e., between O(log n) and O(log^2 n) hops, n: total number of experts in the network). Based on such theoretical foundation, we further study how the unique properties of decentralized search in expert networks is related to the anecdotal small-world phenomenon. In addition, we demonstrate that decentralized search is robust against estimation errors introduced by misinterpreting the required expertise levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying fundamental behaviors of decentralized search in expert networks. The developed performance bounds, confirmed by real datasets, are able to assist in predicting network performance and designing complex expert networks."

        "abstract": "Effective integration of Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) environments in military education depends on many factors. The paper reports analysis across two semesters of the US Military Academy's experience incorporating Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3) simulation into classroom instruction. We (1) assess the impact of VBS3 simulations on the effectiveness of military science course instruction (2) evaluate cadets' perceptions and attitudes regarding VBS3 simulation (3) explore the impacts of team dynamics and leadership characteristics on cadets team performance. These outcomes provide insights on the successes and challenges of using VBS3 in the military science curriculum. Successes include positive perceptions of VBS3 and course relevance, increasing the accuracy of self-estimation of current and future performance, and utilizing VBS3 for course content integration with cadets' field training. However, results also show that increased use of virtual simulation slightly decreased performance on tests and other graded events, raising questions about a possible mismatch between course assessments and what cadets learn from simulation. Impact of virtual simulation may be improved by additional or modified assessments of the tactical skills learned using VBS3 to reinforce these skills. Increased tactical skill reinforcement may increase cadets' declarative and procedural knowledge, potentially increasing knowledge transfer into live training performance. The paper also discusses lessons learned about the simulation tool lifecycle and educational context of virtual simulation in the classroom. Successful adoption required investments in scenario development, instructor training, and simulation laboratory infrastructure. Individual faculty were able to tailor use of the virtual experience through different approaches to the platoon leader briefing, simulated pre-mission reconnaissance, real-time adjustments to the scenario and computer-controlled OPFOR, and after action review. Finally, the paper presents initial qualitative analysis of classroom observations and VBS3 game logs showing how differences in team leadership and communication impact team performance within virtual tactical scenarios."

        "abstract": "Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) offer some unique capabilities for teaching skills related to teamwork and leadership, particularly in the realistic context of tasks and working relationships which evolve over days or weeks. This paper reports on the results and lessons learned from two semesters of deploying an educational ARG-based activity within an MBA course. We describe the pedagogical goals, development of a reusable platform for deploying educational ARGs, scenario design, level of effort needed to administer the game, learner interactions, and learning results. Because some features typical in entertainment ARGs are likely to cause pedagogical or logistical difficulties, the ARG paradigm was modified to address such challenges. For example, a standard characteristic of ARGs is that the majority of participants act as passive observers rather than actively contributing to group work products, potentially negating the benefit of hands-on learning. To address this issue of low average participant activity, the instructor simultaneously deployed many parallel shards rather than a single instance of the unfolding scenario. Running multiple separate instances of the event facilitates greater average participant activity, but also demands different technology infrastructure and event administration. We also describe the impact of different levels of player anonymity. The learning experience was more successful for groups participating using player-selected pseudonyms, compared to groups participating using their real names or using assigned anonymous identifiers. This effect may be related to participants being more willing to explore a challenging activity when their real identity is hidden, and being more invested after selecting their secret identity. Finally, we discuss future directions and how the overall design approach and framework could be applied in military education."

        "abstract": "Growth models have been proposed for constructing the scale-free overlay topology to improve the performance of unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. However, previous growth models are able to maintain the limited scale-free topology when nodes only join but do not leave the network; the case of nodes leaving the network while preserving a precise scaling parameter is not included in the solution. Thus, the full dynamic of node participation, inherent in P2P networks, is not considered in these models. In order to handle both nodes joining and leaving the network, we propose a robust growth model E-SRA, which is capable of producing the perfect limited scale-free overlay topology with user-defined scaling parameter and hard cut-off. Scalability of our approach is ensured since no global information is required to add or remove a node. E-SRA is also tolerant to individual node failure caused by errors or attacks. Simulations have shown that E-SRA out-performs other growth models by producing topologies with high adherence\nto the desired scale-free property. Search algorithms, including flooding and normalized flooding, achieve higher efficiency over the topologies produced by E-SRA."

A bidirectional LSTM model is built to train over the abstract form of questions and infer their answer types. It is also observed that if we convert a question into a statement form, our LSTM model achieves better accuracy. Using the predicted type information to rerank the logical forms returned by AgendaIL, one of the leading semantic parsers, we are able to improve the F1-score from 49.7% to 52.6% on the WEBQUESTIONS data."

This distribution has been found in numerous areas such as accounting data, voting registers, census data, and even in natural phenomena. Recently it has been reported that Benfords law applies to online social networks. Here we introduce a set of rigorous tests for adherence to Benfords law and apply it to verification of this claim, extending the scope of the experiment to various complex networks and to artificial networks created by several popular generative models. Our findings are negative, we do not find sufficient evidence for common conformity of network structural properties with Benfords distribution, in neither real nor artificial networks. We find very weak evidence suggesting that one of centrality measures, betweenness, could adhere to Benfords law, but this conclusion is reached by a minority of statistical tests."

        "abstract": "Quality of Information (QoI) provides a context-dependent measure of the utility that a network delivers to its users by incorporating non-traditional information attributes.  Quickly and easily predicting performance and limitations of a network using QoI metrics is a valuable tool for network design.  Even more useful is an understanding of how network components like topology, bandwidth, protocols, etc. impact these limitations.  In this paper, we develop a QoI-based framework that can provide accurate estimates for limitations on network size and achievable QoI requirements, focusing on completeness and timeliness.  We extend this framework to model competing flows and data loads as random variables to capture the stochastic nature of real networks.  We show that our framework can provide a characterization of delays for satisfied queries to further analyze performance when some late arrivals are acceptable.  Analysis shows that large tradeoffs exist between netowkr parameters, such as QoI requirements, topology, and network size.  Simulation results also provide evidence that the developed framework can estimate network limits and delays with high accuracy.  Finally, this work also introduces scalably feasible QoI regions, which provide upper bounds on QoI requirements that can be supported for certain network applications."

        "abstract": "Expert networks are formed by a group of expert-professionals with different specialties to collaboratively resolve specific queries posted to the network. In expert networks, decentralized search, operating purely on each expert's local information without any knowledge of network global structure, represents the most basic and scalable routing mechanism. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the efficiency of decentralized search. In this regard, we investigate decentralized search by quantifying its performance under a variety of network settings. Our key findings reveal that under certain network conditions, decentralized search can achieve significantly small query routing steps (i.e., between $O(\\\\log n)$ and $O(\\\\log^2 n)$, $n$: total number of experts in the network). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying fundamental behaviors of decentralized search in expert networks."

        "abstract": "When individuals interact with each other and meaningfully contribute toward a common goal, it results in a collaboration, as can be seen in many walks of life such as scientific research, motion picture production, or team sports. Each individual may participate in multiple collaborations at once or over time, resulting in a non-trivial collaboration structure. The artifacts resulting from a collaboration (e.g. papers, movies) are best captured using a hypergraph model, whereas the relation of who has collaborated with whom is best captured via an abstract simplicial complex (SC).\nIn this paper, we propose a generative algorithm GeneSCs for SCs modeling fundamental col- laboration relations, primarily based on preferential attachment. The proposed network growth process favors attachment that is preferential not to an individuals degree, i.e., how many people has he/she collaborated with, but to his/her facet degree, i.e., how many maximal groups or facets has he/she collaborated within. Unlike graphs, where a nodes degree can capture its first order local connectivity properties, in SCs, both facet degrees (of nodes) and facet sizes are important to capture connectivity properties. Based on our observation that several real-world facet size distri- butions have significant deviation from power lawmainly due to the fact that larger facets tend to subsume smaller oneswe adopt a data-driven approach. We seed GeneSCs with a facet size distribution informed by collaboration network data and randomly grow the SC facet-by-facet to generate a final SC whose facet degree distribution matches real data. We prove that the facet degree distribution yielded by GeneSCs is power law distributed for large SCs and show that it is in agreement with real world co-authorship data. Finally, based on our intuition of collaboration formation in domains such as collaborative scientific experiments and movie production, we propose two variants of GeneSCs based on clamped and hybrid preferential attachment schemes, and show that they perform well in these domains."

        "abstract": "Detecting a small number of outliers from a set of data observations is always challenging. This problem is more difficult in the setting of multiple network samples, where computing the anomalous degree of a network sample is generally not sufficient. In fact, explaining why a given network is exceptional, expressed in the form of subnetwork, is also equally important. We develop a novel algorithm to address these two key problems. We treat each network sample as a potential outlier and identify subnetworks that help discriminate it from nearby samples. The algorithm is developed in the framework of network regression combined with the constraints on both network topology and L1-norm shrinkage to perform subnetwork discovery. Our method thus goes beyond subspace/subgraph discovery. We also show that the developed method converges to a global optimum. Empirical evaluation on various real-world network datasets demonstrates the advantages of our algorithm over various baseline methods."

        "abstract": "The value of research containing novel combinations of molecules can be seen in many innovative and award-winning research programs. Despite calls to use innovative approaches to address common diseases, an increasing majority of research funding goes toward \\\\safe* incremental research. Counteracting this trend by nurturing novel and potentially transformative scientific research is challenging, it must be supported in competition with established research programs. Therefore, we propose a tool that helps to resolve the tension between safe/fundable research vs. high-risk/potentially transformational research. It does this by identifying hidden overlapping interest around novel molecular research topics. Specifically, it identifies paths of molecular interactions that connect research topics and hypotheses that would not typically be associated, as the basis for scientific collaboration. Because these collaborations are related to the scientists' present trajectory, they are low risk and can be initiated rapidly. Unlike most incremental steps, these collaborations have the potential for leaps in understanding, as they reposition research for novel disease applications. We demonstrate the use of this tool to identify scientists who could contribute to understanding the cellular role of genes with novel associations with Alzheimer's disease, which have not been thoroughly characterized, in part due to the funding emphasis on established research."

Moreover, we rigorously show that under a certain condition on the magnitude of the nonzero singular values, the proposed estimator enjoys oracle property (i.e., exactly recovers the true rank of the matrix), besides attaining a faster rate. As far as we know, this is the first work that establishes the theory of low-rank matrix estimation with nonconvex penalties, confirming the advantages of nonconvex penalties for matrix completion. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets corroborate our theory."

        "abstract": "Representing and summarizing human behaviors with rich contexts facilitates behavioral sciences and user-oriented services. Traditional behavioral modeling represents a behavior as a tuple in which each element is one contextual factor of one type, and the tensor-based summaries look for high-order dense blocks by clustering the values (including timestamps) in each dimension. However, the human behaviors are multicontextual and dynamic: (1) each behavior takes place within multiple contexts in a few dimensions, which requires the representation to enable non-value and set-values for each dimension; (2) many behavior collections, such as tweets or papers, evolve over time. In this paper, we represent the behavioral data as a two-level matrix (temporal-behaviors by dimensional-values) and propose a novel representation for behavioral summary called Tartan that includes a set of dimensions, the values in each dimension, a list of consecutive time slices and the behaviors in each slice. We further develop a propagation method CATCHTAR-TAN to catch the dynamic multicontextual patterns from the temporal multidimensional data in a principled and scalable way: it determines the meaningfulness of updating every element in the Tartan by minimizing the encoding cost in a compression manner. CATCHTARTAN outperforms the baselines on both the accuracy and speed. We apply CATCHTARTAN to four Twitter datasets up to 10 million tweets and the DBLP data, providing comprehensive summaries for the events, human life and scientific development."

The relevant hostnames for a query can be a signature that captures the query intent. In this study, we learn the hostname preference of queries, which are further utilized to enhance search relevance. Implicit and explicit query intent are modeled simultaneously by a feature aware matrix completion framework. A block-wise parallel algorithm was developed on top of the Spark MLlib for fast optimization of feature aware matrix completion. The optimization completes within minutes at the scale of a million  million matrix, which enables efficient experimental studies at the web scale. Evaluation of the learned hostname preference is performed both intrinsically on test errors, and extrinsically on the impact on search ranking relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that capturing hostname preference can significantly boost the retrieval performance."

        "abstract": "Understanding human mobility is of great importance to various applications, such as urban planning, traffic scheduling, and location prediction. While there has been fruitful research on modeling human mobility using tracking data (e.g., GPS traces), the recent growth of geo-tagged social media (GeoSM) brings new opportunities to this task because of its sheer size and multi-dimensional nature. Nevertheless, how to obtain quality mobility models from the highly sparse and complex GeoSM data remains a challenge that cannot be readily addressed by existing techniques.\n\nWe propose GMOVE, a group-level mobility modeling method using GeoSM data. Our insight is that the GeoSM data usually contains multiple user groups, where the users within the same group share significant movement regularity. Meanwhile, user grouping and mobility modeling are two intertwined tasks: (1) better user grouping offers better within-group data consistency and thus leads to more reliable mobility models; and (2) better mobility models serve as useful guidance that helps infer the group a user belongs to. GMOVE thus alternates between user grouping and mobility modeling, and generates an ensemble of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to characterize group-level movement regularity. Furthermore, to reduce text sparsity of GeoSM data, GMOVE also features a text augmenter. The augmenter computes keyword correlations by examining their spatiotemporal distributions. With such correlations as auxiliary knowledge, it performs sampling-based augmentation to alleviate text sparsity and produce high-quality HMMs.\n\nOur extensive experiments on two real-life data sets demonstrate that GMOVE can effectively generate meaningful group-level mobility models. Moreover, with context-aware location prediction as an example application, we find that GMOVE significantly outperforms baseline mobility models in terms of prediction accuracy."

        "abstract": "Network active search focuses on collecting certain labeled nodes (target nodes) given global knowledge of the network topology and its edge weights (encoding pairwise similarities) under a query budget constraint. However, in todays prevalent form of network search (crawling), all nodes, the network topology, its size, and its edge weights are all initially hidden. In this work we introduce selective harvesting, a variant of active search where the next node to be queried must be chosen among the neighbors of the current queried node set; the available training data for deciding which node to query is restricted to the subgraph induced by the queried set (and their node attributes) and their neighbors (currently without any node or edge attributes). The queried set is expanded by querying neighbors of nodes in the set. A classifier trained in this scenario suffers from what we call a tunnel vision effect: without any recourse to independent sampling, the urge to only query promising nodes forces classifiers to gather increasingly biased training data, which we show significantly hurts the performance of active search methods and standard classifiers. We discover that the key to collecting a larger set of target nodes lies in using multiple classifiers, not to combine their predictions (boosting) but as a way to ease the tunnel vision effect: we show that switching classifiers at each step collects more target nodes by (a) diversifying the training data and (b) broadening the choices of nodes that can be queried in the future. This highlights an exploration, exploitation, and diversification tradeoff in our problem that goes beyond the exploration and exploitation duality found in classic sequential decision problems. Based on these observations we propose D3TS, a method based on multi-armed bandits for non-stationary stochastic processes that forces classifier diversity, which outperforms all competing methods on 5 out of 7 real network datasets in our evaluation and exhibits comparable performance on the other two."

        "abstract": "Army forces operate in a connected environment consisting of different types of social, information, and communication networks, some within the exclusive control of the military and some that are used and controlled externally by others.  Generally, the performance and success of these networks are studied independently, but in a military context mission success depends to a significant degree upon the ability to effectively establish command and control utilizing these collectives of networks. Thus there is a need to understand the inter-dependencies of these co-evolving networks.  As one co-networks behavior can lead to the failure cascades of another co-network or a co-networks behavior can affect the agility of command and control.  In previous work we examined cross-genre network interactions between a constrained communication network and social/cognitive network within a Company Intelligence Support Team (CoIST) inspired scenario.  We considered network parameters like group organization, policies regarding information propagation, and communications network bandwidth.  Using the same integrated simulation platform as in previous work, we utilize a slice of the network topology to explore the impact on mission success given varying levels of noise (i.e. irrelevant content) in the information network.   Expanding the multi-genre network parameter space allows us to further understand the interoperability of these network types under a broader range of military relevant network conditions. Experimental results can potentially be applied to design networks to meet operational objectives, improve shared situation awareness, dynamically adapt to the unfolding knowledge terrain, and suggest the network layer where security approaches would be the most effective."

Current techniques do not have the ability to discern unusual features or patterns that are not a priori known. We investigate the use of deep learning for network analysis. Over the last few years, deep learning has had unprecedented success in areas such as image classification, speech recognition, etc. However, research on the use of deep learning to network or graph analysis is limited. We discuss the benefits of and challenges in the use of deep learning for graph analysis, and present three preliminary techniques that we have developed as part of the ARL Network Science CTA program: (a) unsupervised classification using a very highly trained image recognizer, namely Caffe; (b) supervised classification using a variant of\nconvolutional neural networks on node features such as degree and assortativity; and (c) a framework called node2vec for learning representations of nodes in a network using a mapping to natural language processing."

In an ideal world, every stationary object or entity in the built environment would be associated with position, so that applications can have precise spatial context about the environment surrounding a human. In this paper, we take a step towards this ideal: by analyzing images from Google Street View that cover different perspectives of a given object and triangulating the location of the object, our system, ALPS, can discover and localize common landmarks at the scale of a city accurately and with high coverage. ALPS contains several novel techniques that help improve the accuracy, coverage, and scalability of localization. Evaluations of ALPS on many cities in the United States show that it can localize storefronts with a coverage higher than 90% and a median error of 5 meters."

        "abstract": "In social networks, individuals and systems work side by side. While individuals make decisions to filter or forward information, systems also prioritize and sort information to manage and assist individual information processing. It has long been argued that system level manipulations can reduce access of individuals to novel information. In this paper, we study how sorting of messages in ones inbox can help or hinder access of diverse information in the network through simulation of cognitively bounded actors. We show that first-in-first-out (FIFO) method of message sorting is ideal in bursty information arrival rates and in networks with lower diameter. Last-in-first- out (LIFO) method of message sorting is ideal for streaming information arrival, but leads to information overload in bursty scenarios by creating too many redundant copies of some of the information in the network. In short, the ideal message sorting method that enhances access to diverse information depends on the network type and information access patterns."

        "abstract": "The use of social media online has grown dramatically over recent years with hundreds of social networking sites \nfacilitating the sharing of information from anywhere at any time. In 2014 over two billion social media users were\nreported worldwide. Social media sites are steadily growing in importance as information sources on political issues\nand current events. For instance Twitter has been noted as the first source of available information during events\nsuch as political unrest, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters. Unfortunately, Twitter users posts and retweets can\ncause confusion by spreading misinformation during an event. To siphon the most accurate information from social\nmedia, an understanding of how personal social biases affect information sharing at the transmission level is needed.\nWe designed an experiment to explore social bias factors influencing social media information transmission. The\nexperiment, hosted on Amazon Mechanical Turk, examines the effects of personal bias in relation to users\nlikelihood of sharing or contradicting information concerning three types of events: natural disaster, conflict, and\ntraffic as a control event. Additionally, the users relationship to the recipients of the information transmission and\nthe type of communication platform are explored. The results from this study can inform the development of more\neffective fact-finding and credibility ranking algorithms enabling new technologies to extract useful and actionable\nintelligence from information shared by social media users."

Recent literature developed a mathematical approach for exploiting social networks, such as Twitter, as noisy sensor networks that report observations on the state of the physical world. It was shown that the quality of state estimation from such noisy data, known as fact-nding, was a function of assumptions made regarding the independence of sources or lack thereof. When sources propagate information they hear from others (without verication), correlated errors may arise that degrade fact-nding performance. This work advances the state of the art by developing a simplied model of dependencies between sources and designing an improved dependency-aware estimator to assess veracity of observations, taking into account the observed dependency structure. A fundamental error bound is derived for this estimator to understand the gap in its performance from optimal. It is shown that the new estimator outperforms state of the art fact-nders and, in some cases, yields an accuracy close to the fundamental error bound. "

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things heralds a new generation of data-centric applications, where controllers connect to large numbers of heterogeneous sensing devices. We consider a model, where the control loop does not execute periodically. Instead, controllers are prompted by contextual cues to make one-off decisions, resulting in sporadic activations. Since the need for data arises only sporadically, sensors do not sample data continuously. Rather, they are normally off (e.g., to save energy), but are activated by the controller on demand, when data is needed. Collected data has validity intervals, after which it must be re-sampled, since the measured value may change. Once a decision is made based on the data, sensors are turned off again. We call this model sporadic decision-centric data scheduling with normally off sensors. It gives rise to novel scheduling problems because of the way the timing of activation of different sensors affects load attributed to data sampling; the shorter the interval between activation of a given sensor and the time a corresponding decision is made, the lower the number of samples taken by that sensor to support the decision, and thus decision cost. The paper introduces a few decision-centric data scheduling problems and offers cost optimality results for some simple cases.\n"

        "abstract": "The explosive growth in social networks that publish real-time content begs the question of whether their feeds can complement traditional sensors to achieve augmented sensing capabilities. One such capability is to explain anomalous sensor readings. In our previous conference paper, we built an automated anomaly clarification service, called ClariSense, with the ability to explain sensor anomalies using social network feeds (from Twitter). In this extended work, we present an enhanced anomaly explanation system that augments our base algorithm by considering both (i) the credibility of social feeds and (ii) the spatial locality of detected anomalies. The work is geared specifically for describing small-footprint anomalies, such as vehicular traffic accidents. The original system used information gain to select more informative microblog items to explain physical sensor anomalies. In this paper, we show that signicant improvements are achieved in our ability to explain small-footprint anomalies by accounting for information credibility and further discriminating among high information-gain items according to the size of their spatial footprint. Hence, items that lack sufficient corroboration and items whose spatial footprint in the blogosphere is not specfic to the approximate location of the physical anomaly receive less consideration. We briey demonstrate the workings of such a system by considering a variety of real world\nanomalous events, and comparing their causes, as identified by ClariSense+, to ground truth for validation. A more systematic evaluation of this work is done using vehicular traffic anomalies. Specifically, we consider real-time traffic ow feeds shared\nby the California traffic system. When ow anomalies are detected, our system automatically diagnoses their root cause by correlating the anomaly with feeds on Twitter. For evaluation purposes, the identified cause is then retroactively compared to official traffic and incident reports that we take as ground truth. Results show a great correspondence between our automatically selected explanations and ground-truth data."

        "abstract": "The paper develops a recursive state estimator for social network data streams that allows exploitation of social networks, such as Twitter, as sensor networks to reliably observe physical events. Recent literature suggested using social networks as sensor networks leveraging the fact that much of the information upload on the former constitutes acts of sensing. A significant challenge identified in that context was that source reliability is often unknown, leading to uncertainty regarding the veracity of reported observations. Multiple truth nding systems were developed to solve this problem, generally geared towards batch analysis of ofine data sets. This work complements the present batch approaches by developing an online recursive state estimator that recovers ground truth from streaming data. In this paper, we model physical world state by a set of binary signals(propositions,called assertions, about world state) and the social network as a noisy medium, where distortion, fabrication, omissions, and duplication are introduced. Our recursive state estimator is designed to recover the original binary signal (the true propositions) from the received noisy signal, essentially decoding the unreliable social network output to obtain the best estimate of ground truth in the physical world. Results show that the estimator is both effective and efficient at recovering the original signal with a high degree of accuracy. The estimator gives rise to a novel situation awareness tool that can be used for reliably following unfolding events in real time, using dynamically arriving social network data.\n"

        "abstract": "In this document, we describe the design of the eXperimentation in Composite Networks (XCN) Framework. This framework is built with the goal of simplifying writing and running network science experiments. A critical aspect of network science research is to be able to study multiple network genres simultaneously, specifically communications, social/cognitive, and information networks. To run many types of multi-genre experiments, the XCN Framework uses two generic concepts. The first is a singular (global) environment space. The second is a node, which, in different areas of network research, can be defined in different ways. The environment contains one to many nodes that in turn create some form of network. Nodes are intentionally left as an abstract concept to allow the experiment designer to define what a node is and therefore how the network is put together. Because a multi-genre experiment framework of this sort has never been done before, the design is written to be easy to modify or extend as new definitions of nodes are incorporated into the framework and as understanding of experimentation in multi-genre network evolves.\n\nNetwork science experiments tend to be highly complex in terms of configuring and starting all the external modules required for multi-genre experiments. The XCN Framework solves the configuration issue by providing methods to encapsulate each module in the system so it can be automatically configured for the current experiment. We recognize that many modules were originally built to only study a single network genre or problem space. Therefore, it is important for network science experiments to be able to integrate multiple different modules together within a single experiment to be able to study the interactions between different network genres. In the XCN Framework, external modules can be hooked into either the environment or one or more nodes by utilizing a scripting interface, defined later in this document.\n\nThe components of the XCN Framework consist of scenario (configuration) files, module files, and the underlying framework scripts. The underlying framework scripts control the workflow of the experiment. Module files are Python scripts that encapsulate a module, allowing it to be configured automatically by the integrator such that it is a plug-and-play component in an experiment. The scenario files are designed to be a short, simple, and extensible method of defining an experiment. Most users will only modify scenario files by specifying which modules they want along with setting the dependent variables for the experiment.\n"

Extensive previous work has shown that dense blocks in tensors as well as graphs indicate anomalous or fraudulent behavior (e.g., lockstep behavior in social networks). However, available methods for detecting such dense blocks are not satisfactory in terms of speed, accuracy, or flexibility. In this work, we propose M-Zoom, a flexible framework for finding dense blocks in tensors, which works with a broad class of density measures. M-Zoom has the following properties: (1) Scalable: M-Zoom scales linearly with all aspects of tensors and is up to 114 faster than state-of-the-art methods with similar accuracy. (2) Provably accurate: M-Zoom provides a guarantee on the lowest density of the blocks it finds. (3) Flexible: M-Zoom supports multi-block detection and size bounds\nas well as diverse density measures. (4) Effective: M-Zoom successfully detected edit wars and bot activities in Wikipedia, and spotted network attacks from a TCP dump with near-perfect accuracy (AUC=0.98)."

A k-core is the maximal subgraph where all vertices have degree at least k. This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis, graph visualization, and graph clustering. Here, we explore pervasive patterns that are related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from several diverse domains.\nOur discoveries are as follows: (1) Mirror Pattern: coreness of vertices (i.e., maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core) is strongly correlated to their degree. (2) Core-Triangle Pattern: degeneracy of a graph (i.e., maximum k such that the k-core exists in the graph) obeys a 3-to-1 power law with respect to the count of triangles. (3) Structured Core Pattern: degeneracy-cores are not cliques but have non-trivial structures such as core-periphery and communities.\nOur algorithmic contributions show the usefulness of these patterns. (1) Core-A, which measures the deviation from Mirror Pattern, successfully finds anomalies in real-world graphs complementing densest-subgraph based anomaly detection methods. (2) Core-D, a single-pass streaming algorithm based on Core-Triangle Pattern, accurately estimates the degeneracy of billion-scale graphs up to 7_x0002_ faster than a recent multipass algorithm.(3) Core-S, inspired by Structured Core Pattern, identifies influential spreaders up to 17_x0002_ faster than top competitors with comparable accuracy."

Yet the characteristics of teams that work effectively are not fully understood. We focus on the problem of identifying particularly effective teams in a large, complex, social network. More specifically, given some task, and taking into account measures of both the effectiveness of an individual and the strength of the pairwise ties between individuals, can we identify the subgroup of people who are most likely to accomplish said task? Our experimental work using the DBLP suggests that within any given subgroup, not all ties\nare of equal relevance. In fact, we show that focusing on the ties between one individual and the other group members\nwill suffice. However, whereas the problem of finding the best subgroup is equivalent to MAX-CLIQUE and is thus hard to approximate, the problem of finding the best star is computationally tractable. We present experimental\nevidence justifying interest in the star, as opposed to the clique, and discuss algorithmic and complexity concerns.\n"

NoTs arise in several contexts\nsuch as large software projects, sensors cooperating for target tracking, and terrorist cell networks. Modeling a NoT as a simplicial\ncomplex, we consider the problem of quantifying the strength of a NoT using metrics based purely on its structure.

We define three kinds of monotonicity  weak, team, and structural  depending upon whether we\nadd or remove nodes, entire teams, or facets. We propose seven strength metrics and show what properties they promote if used to\nguide an evolutionary network formation process. We analyze their monotonicity, prove that some metrics are monotonic or show small\ncounterexamples otherwise, then we experimentally test them on a range of randomly generated networks. Finally, we quantify the\nsimilarity between the metrics by comparing how they rank the same sets of networks, thus also providing a mechanism for evaluating\nhow well a metric matches the knowledge about the networks performance."

        "abstract": "Sensor networks and the Internet of Things motivate novel classes of job scheduling problems where each job corresponds to downloading some data object from the sensor network, i.e., querying the network for (some portion of) its current state. The purposes of scheduling a collection of jobs may be to support more decision tasks, where the user will decide on a course of action, prior to a deadline, based on the downloaded data. This purpose, combined with the fact that the sensors are reporting the current state of environmental variables that are changing over time, motivates the notion of a jobs freshness or validity window, the maximum amount of time after the completion of the download that piece of data is considered reliable, which may vary based on several factors. Not only must all given decision tasks jobs complete before the deadline, but in order for the decision to be made based on reliable data, there must be a time when its jobs are all simultaneously fresh. Jobs can be performed at different Quality of Information levels, and while downloading a job consumes the full bandwidth of a communication channel. We investigate offline scheduling problems of this nature under several scenarios, beginning with the case of one task, i.e., a single deadline for all jobs, which represents querying the current global state of the sensor network. We give a polynomial-time optimal algorithm for the problem of maximizing the number of scheduled jobs using a single channel and a (log n) 1-approximation algorithm for the problem of scheduling all jobs using a minimum number of channels, as well as algorithms and heuristics for several special cases and extensions. We also present a surprising connection between such freshness-constrained data scheduling problems and traditional scheduling problems. Finally, in a performance evaluation we find that our (log n)-approximation algorithm consistently outperforms natural heuristics like First Fit and Best Fit.\n\n"

        "abstract": "Predicting a successful collaborative effort has been an important problem in academic research for a long time. It seems reasonable to assume that prior collaboration should be a good predictor of future success. That is, groups that have worked together in the past are likely to succeed on further projects, and forming a new group whose members already share some collaborative ties is a more promising prospect than forming groups of individuals with no history between them. Following this logic to its conclusion, one would assume that the predicted success of a new group should increase monotonically with the amount of prior collaboration that exists within it.\n\nOur research indicates that this intuition is largely correct, teams with higher amounts of prior collaboration do tend to produce better results, but this phenomenon actually hits a tipping point towards the end of its curve and then decreases with the highest amounts of prior collaboration.\n\nWe analyze the APS Journals data set, studying papers published by three or four authors working together for the first time. In order to look for more practically applicable predictive patterns, we take a dynamic approach, working through the dataset in chronological order and basing our analyses solely on the information that was available when the authors published their paper. We study simple graphs, weighted graphs, and simplicial complexes in order to consider varied means of measuring prior collaboration. In every case there is a strong indication that more prior collaboration generally predicts more success, but the highest amounts of prior collaboration tend to achieve less success than the slightly more moderate amounts.\n\nStar-like topologies in particular emerge as having a good amount of prior collaboration. We suggest that an author bringing together their colleagues on a project can serve as a team leader, but when these colleagues have already collaborated the group lacks a focal point and is not as cohesive. This is especially noteworthy as previous studies have already recommended the star topology for reasons of algorithmic efficiency. Together, these findings suggest a novel and somewhat counter-intuitive approach to building potentially successful teams. \n"

For instance, and beyond\nthe natural goal of forming successful new collaborations, one might wish\nto have a network that is well connected or with a small diameter, just\nto name two plausible desired properties. To that end,\ncan we determine whether new changes in the collaboration structure\nare beneficial or detrimental to those goals?\n \nPreviously, the authors proposed several metrics for measuring *strength* \nthat assign a real-valued score based on the network's structural properties\n(such as the number of teams an individual is part of and the size of \nthe teams). We investigate various metrics to guide an evolutionary \nprocess of collaborative network formation by seeking random alternatives \nthat maximize the metrics. Alternatives may include the addition of new \ncollaborations as well as maintaining/enhancing previous collaborations.\nBy simulating this evolutionary process, we identify the effects of each\nmetric, the qualities and structural properties it promotes,\nand the situations in which it may be applicable.\n\nFor instance, the metrics let us control the network evolution by promoting\nor prohibiting the degree of team overlap, increasing or decreasing \nthe size and the number of teams, controlling network connectedness and\nits diameter. We identify interesting and sometimes counter-intuitive\nrelationships between existing collaboration properties and future\nstructure of the whole collaboration network. That is, we propose specific\nrecommendations for new collaborations that would lead to desirable \nnetwork structure."

We present a cubic time approximation algorithm that computes a 2-path partition whose total weight is at least .5833 of the weight of an optimal partition; improving upon the (.5265 epsilon)-approximation algorithm of [24]. Restricting the input graph to have edge weights in {0, 1}, we present a .75 approximation algorithm improving upon the .55-approximation algorithm of [14]. Combining this algorithm with a previously known approximation algorithm for the 3-Set Packing problem, we obtain a .6-approximation algorithm for the problem of partitioning a {0, 1}-edge-weighted graph into k vertex disjoint triangles of maximum total weight.

        "abstract": "We examine the dynamics of co-evolution of two coupled social networks. The first is a cognitive network defined by nominations based on perceived prominence collected from repeated surveys of students during their first four semesters of college while the second is built from the behavioral network representing actual interactions between these individuals based on records of their mobile calls and text messages. We address three interrelated questions. First, we ask whether the formation or dissolution of a link in one of the networks precedes or succeeds formation or dissolution of the corresponding link in the other network (temporal dependencies). Second, we explore the causes of observed temporal dependencies between the two networks. For those temporal dependencies that are confirmed, we measure the predictive capacity of such dependencies. Finally, we examine whether there are systematic differences in the dissolution rates of symmetric (undirected) versus asymmetric (directed) edges in both networks. We find strong patterns of reciprocal temporal dependencies between the two networks. In particular, the creation of an edge in the behavioral network generally precedes the formation of a corresponding edge in the cognitive network. Conversely, the decay of a link in the cognitive network generally precedes a decline in the intensity of communication in the behavioral network. Finally, asymmetric edges in the cognitive network have lower overall communication volume and more asymmetric communication flows in the behavioral network."

        "abstract": "Expert networks are formed by a group of expert-professionals with different specialties to collaboratively resolve specific queries posted to the network. In such networks, when a query reaches an expert who does not have sufficient expertise, this query needs to be routed to other experts for further processing until it is completely solved; therefore, query answering efficiency is sensitive to the underlying query routing mechanism being used. Among all possible query routing mechanisms, decentralized search, operating purely on each expert's local information without any knowledge of network global structure, represents the most basic and scalable routing mechanism, which is applicable to any network scenarios even in dynamic networks. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the efficiency of decentralized search in expert networks. In this regard, we investigate decentralized search by quantifying its performance under a variety of network settings. Our key findings reveal the existence of network conditions, under which decentralized search can achieve significantly short query routing paths (i.e., between $O(\\\\log n)$ and $O(\\\\log^2 n)$ hops, $n$: total number of experts in the network). Based on such theoretical foundation, we further study how the unique properties of decentralized search in expert networks is related to the anecdotal small-world phenomenon. In addition, we demonstrate that decentralized search is robust against estimation errors introduced by misinterpreting the required expertise levels. The developed performance bounds, confirmed by real datasets, are able to assist in predicting network performance and designing complex expert networks."

For the latter, the encoders and/or the decoder have access to a common observation conditioned on which the two sources are independent. By establishing necessary and sufficient conditions, we show the optimality of separation when the encoders and the decoder both have access to the common observation. We also demonstrate that separation is optimal when only the encoders have access to the common observation whose lossless recovery is required at the decoder.

As such, the type of relationship between two persons, whether positive or negative, impacts how they are influenced by one another. Signed social networks are defined as networks in which individuals can be linked with positive or negative relationships. We provide an overview of the influence diffusion and propagation models in signed social networks. The first group of problems we discuss is based on influence diffusion and maximization in signed networks, among which we review the voter model, epidemic models, independent cascade model, and game theoretic models. These models focus on the spread behavior of opinions in a signed social network or on identifying the key nodes that can trigger a propagation behavior leading to maximum influence spread. Next, we review the optimal propagation algorithms for influencing a target node positively by taking into account the propagation costs or the number of negatively influenced persons on the propagation path. The propagation cost is incurred by both social and physical entities such as propagation delay, strength of social ties, or the influence factor of the propagating idea. The propagation model is then extended by incorporating the impact of message deterioration and ignorance probability of the interacting parties. "

Low delays enable improved information flow in social networks, quick spread of ideas in collaboration networks, low travel times for vehicles on road networks and increased rate of packets in communication networks. Delay reduction can be achieved by both improving the propagation capabilities of individual nodes and adding additional edges in the network. One of the main challenges in such design problems is that the effects of local changes are not independent, and as a consequence, there is a combinatorial search space of possible improvements. Thus, minimizing the cumulative propagation delay requires novel scalable and data-driven approaches.\n\n\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of network delay minimization via node upgrades. Although the problem is NP-hard, we show that probabilistic approximation for a restricted version can be obtained. We design scalable and high-quality techniques for the general setting based on sampling that are targeted to different models of delay distribution. Our methods scale almost linearly with the graph size and consistently outperform competitors in quality."

        "abstract": "Network centrality plays an important role in many applications. Central nodes in social networks can be influential, driving opinions and spreading news or rumors. In physical networks that model water distribution, power grids and road systems, central nodes can monitor relevant phenomena, such as contamination, outages, and congestion. While there is an extensive amount of work on centrality measures and their efficient computation, controlling nodes' centrality via network updates is a more recent and challenging problem. Performing minimal modifications to a network to achieve a desired property falls under the umbrella of network design problems. This paper is focused on improving the coverage centrality of a set of nodes, which is the number of shortest paths passing through them, by adding new edges to the network. We show that the problem is NP-hard and then propose a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm under some mild assumptions. To ensure applicability to large networks, we design a novel sampling algorithm for centrality optimization with probabilistic approximation guarantees. Results show that our approach achieves up to 5 times higher coverage centrality than the baseline solutions on many real-world networks. Moreover, our randomized algorithm scales to million-node networks."

However, there exists no visualization and exploration tool for the HoN. For applications such as the development of strategies to control species invasion through global shipping which is known to exhibit higher-order dependencies, the existing FoN visualization tools are limited. In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novel visual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of the global ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multiple views to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., the global, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of interest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-order nodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is enabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level. Using the global ocean shipping network data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a real-world use case conducted by domain experts specializing in species invasion. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of this framework to other real-world applications such as information diffusion in social networks and epidemic spreading through air transportation.   \n"

        "abstract": "Persistent homology [1] was proposed as an algebraic tool to study features in data at different scales. The approach requires a sequence of densifying simplicial complexes called a filtration. Through constructing a filtration by varying a threshold parameter, persistent homology has been used recently to study topological signatures in static weighted networks [2,3], e.g., scientific collaboration networks, brain networks. We study time evolving collaboration networks using time as the varying parameter, thus leading to a temporal filtration of simplicial complexes, where each simplicial complex in the filtration represents the collaborations occurring until the indicated time. \nThe topological properties of interest that arise from this study are the number of holes, which are a measure of cyclicity, and the higher-dimensional voids. In Figure 1, we contrast the growth in the number of holes in the DBLP and the IMDB datasets over the period of 1950-1989. We observe that the number of cycles in the DBLP dataset grows exponentially with time, while for the IMDB dataset it is almost linear. We also find that the IMDB dataset possesses more higher-dimensional structures or voids. For both datasets, we find that an overwhelmingly large amount of homology (> 99% of holes and voids) is found in the largest connected component. This has some similarity with the result in [4, p. 410] for Erdos-Renyi graphs, which states that the probability of small components being acyclic tends to one in the limit of large graph size, while noting the fact that they are not good models for the aforementioned datasets. These results leads us to conclude that persistent homology could be used as a tool to study and compare evolving collaboration networks. As future work, we intend to propose generative models that could simulate the evolution of collaboration networks."

        "abstract": "The Naming Game has proven to be an important model of opinion dynamics in complex networks. It is significantly enriched by the introduction of nodes committed to a single opinion. The resulting model is still simple but captures core concepts of opinion dynamics in networks. This model limitation is rigid commitment which never changes. Here we study the effect that making commitment variable has on the dynamics of the system. Committed nodes are assigned a commitment strength, w, defining their willingness to lose (in waning), gain (for increasing) or both (in variable) commitment to an opinion. Such model has committed nodes that can stick to a single opinion for some time without losing their flexibility to change it in the long run. The traditional Naming Game corresponds to setting w at infinity. A change in commitment strength impacts the critical fraction of population necessary for a minority consensus. Increasing w lowers critical fraction for waning commitment but increases this fraction for increasing commitment. Further, we show that if different nodes have different values of w, higher standard deviation of w increases the critical fraction for waning commitment and decrease this fraction for increasing commitment."

The computational complexity of CI is O(N log N) when removing nodes one-by-one, made possible through an appropriate data structure to process CI. We introduce two Belief-Propagation (BP) variants of CI that consider global optimization via message-passing: CI propagation (CIP) and Collective- Immunization-Belief-Propagation algorithm (CIBP) based on optimal immunization. Both identify a slightly smaller fraction of influencers than CI and, remarkably, reproduce the exact analytical optimal percolation threshold obtained in Random Struct. Alg. 21, 397 (2002) for cubic random regular graphs, leaving little room for improvement for random graphs. However, the small augmented performance comes at the expense of increasing running time to O(N2), rendering BP prohibitive for modern-day big-data. For instance, for big-data social networks of 200 million users (e.g., Twitter users sending 500 million tweets/day), CI finds influencers in 2.5 hours on a single CPU, while all BP algorithms (CIP, CIBP and BDP) would take more than 3,000 years to accomplish the same task."

Here we translate this concept into an operational definition at the network level, which allows us to infer the economic wellness of individuals through a measure of their location in the social network. We analyze two large-scale sources including telecommunication and financial data of a whole country population of 110 million people. Our results show that individuals location, measured as the optimal collective influence in the structural integrity of the social network, can be used to infer personal financial status. For pragmatic use and validation, we carry out a marketing campaign that shows a three-fold increase in response rate by targeting individuals identified by our social network metrics as compared to random targeting. Our strategy could also be useful in maximizing the effects of large-scale economic stimulus policies."

Despite its importance, there has been no conclu- sive scientific evidence so far that social media activity can capture the opinion of the general population at large. Here we develop analytic tools combining statisti- cal physics of complex networks, percolation theory, natural language processing and machine learning classification to infer the opinion of Twitter users regarding the can- didates of the 2016 US Presidential Election. Using a large-scale dataset of 73 million tweets collected from June 1st to September 1st 2016, we investigate the temporal social networks formed by the interactions among millions of Twitter users. We infer the support of each user to the presidential candidates and show that the resulting Twitter trends follow the New York Times National Polling Average, which represents an aggregate of hundreds of independent traditional polls, with remarkable accuracy (r = 0.9). More importantly, the Twitter opinion trend forecasts the aggregated NYT polls by 6 to 15 days, showing that Twitter can be an early warning signal of global opinion trends at the national level. Our analytics [available at kcorelab.com] un- leash the power of Twitter to predict social trends from elections, brands to political movements, and at a fraction of the cost of national polls."

        "abstract": "Identifying the most influential spreaders that maximize information flow is a central question in network theory. Recently, a scalable method called Collective Influence (CI) has been put forward through collective influence maximization. In contrast to heuristic methods evaluating nodes significance separately, CI method inspects the collective influence of multiple spreaders. Despite that CI applies to the influence maximization problem in percolation model, it is still important to examine its efficacy in realistic information spreading. Here, we examine real-world information flow in various social and scientific platforms including American Physical Society, Facebook, Twitter and LiveJournal. Since empirical data cannot be directly mapped to ideal multi-source spreading, we leverage the behavioral patterns of users extracted from data to construct virtual information spreading processes. Our results demonstrate that the set of spreaders selected by CI can induce larger scale of information propagation. Moreover, local measures as the number of connections or citations are not necessarily the deterministic factors of nodes importance in realistic information spreading. This result has significance for rankings scientists in scientific networks like the APS, where the commonly used number of citations can be a poor indicator of the collective influence of authors in the community."

        "abstract": "In many biological and social networks, the collective dynamics of the entire system can be shaped by a small set of influential units through a global cascading process, manifested by an abrupt first-order, or discontinuous transition in dynamical behaviors. Despite its utmost importance in applications, efficient identification of multiple influential spreaders in cascading processes still remains a challenging task for large-scale networks in modern big-data analysis. Here we address this issue by exploring the collective influence in general threshold models of cascading process. Our analysis reveals that the importance of spreaders is fixed by the subcritical paths along which cascades propagate: the number of subcritical paths attached to each spreader determines its contribution to global cascades. The concept of subcritical path allows us to introduce a linearly scalable algorithm for massively large-scale networks. Results in both synthetic random graphs and real networks show that the proposed method can achieve larger collective influence given the same number of seeds compared with other scalable heuristic approaches."

Theoretical attempts to find the causes of the sys- tem collapse have not determined quantitatively the role played by the structural features of the interaction network. Here we solve analytically the fixed point equations to unlock the relation between network and dynamics that controls the collapse of the system. We find that the collapse occurs when the activity in the innermost k-core of the network vanishes, due to the weakening of the inter- action strength. As a key variable involved in collapse phenomena, monitoring of the k-core may prove a powerful method to anticipate catastrophic events across the vast context that stretches between ecology, biological networks and finance."

        "abstract": "Information spreading in complex networks is often modeled as diffusing information with certain probability from nodes\nthat possess it to their neighbors that do not. Information cascades are triggered when the activation of a set of initial nodes  seeds  results in diffusion to large number of nodes. Here, several novel approaches for seed initiation that replace the commonly used activation of all seeds at once with a sequence of initiation stages are introduced. Sequential strategies at later stages avoid seeding highly ranked nodes that are already activated by diffusion active between stages. The gain arises when a saved seed is allocated to a node difficult to reach via diffusion. Sequential seeding and a single stage approach are compared using various seed ranking methods and diffusion parameters on real complex networks. The experimental results indicate that, regardless of the seed ranking method used, sequential seeding strategies deliver better coverage than single stage seeding in about 90% of cases. Longer seeding sequences tend to activate more nodes but they also extend the duration of diffusion. Various variants of sequential seeding resolve the trade-off between the coverage and speed of diffusion differently."

        "abstract": "With the development of Web 2.0 technologies, semantic contents and social inter-actions have become tightly integrated in online social networks and social media such as blogs, micro blogs, and social tagging. Moreover, user generated content on Wikipedia and citizen science sites (e.g., Scitable at Nature Publishing Group), has begun to organize and even generate knowledge from crowd participations.\nMost content generated by users is noisy, ambiguous, and unstructured because of the voluntary nature of contributors and varying reliability of information resources. On the other hand, complex human interactions can provide the rich information to reveal the expertise and credibility of users and in turn optimize the process of information retrieval on the Web. A key problem in constructing and mining semantic spaces is how to utilize users preference information in the process of extracting information structures from unstructured data sources and construct a relevant concept similarity network (Steyvers and Tenenbaum 2005). By jointly considering text and relational data, we propose to analyze multiple dimensions of human expertise and behavior.\nThis chapter proposes a three-layer framework to integrate semantic and social networks and to reveal peoples expertise based on their words and relations. To demonstrate the value of user preference in semantic analysis, we use social tagging activities on CiteUlike as an example to illustrate the potential of utilizing social relations on identifying similar concepts."

        "abstract": "The goal of the applied experimentation effort is to challenge and extend basic network research results by performing experiments focused on interactions between network genres, under more complex or military relevant conditions. The purpose of such applied experiments is to drive basic research direction and bring network science results closer to future Army application. One important composite network phenomena studied in the NSCTA and by other network science researchers is the co-evolution of information and social networks. This type of co-evolution has been examined for a range of opinion dynamics models, where the social network (represented by social relationship links between individual person nodes) and information network (the distribution of personal opinions held on a range of topics by all members of society) affect each other incrementally to drive evolution of both networks towards a stable or quasi-stable state.

        "abstract": "Users with demographic profiles in social networks offer the potential to understand the social principles that underpin our highly connected world, from individuals, to groups, to societies. In this paper, we harness the power of network and data sciences to model the interplay between user demographics and social behavior, and further study to what extent users demographic profiles can be inferred from their mobile communication behaviors. By modeling over 7 million users and 1 billion mobile communication records, we find that during the active dating period, younger users are active in broadening social connections with males and females alike, while after reaching 35 years of age people tend to keep small, closed, and same-gender social circles. Further, we formalize the demographic prediction problem of inferring users gender and age simultaneously. We propose a factor graph-based WhoAmI method to address the problem by leveraging not only the correlations between network features and users gender/age, but also the interrelations between gender and age. In addition, we identify a new problem --- coupled network demographic prediction across multiple mobile operators and present a coupled variant of the WhoAmI method to address its unique challenges. Our experiments demonstrate both the effectiveness and scalability of the WhoAmI method. Finally, our study finds a greater than 80% potential predictability for inferring users gender from phone call behavior and 73% for users age from text messaging interactions."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of age-specific small worlds using data from a large-scale mobile communication net- work approximating interaction patterns at a societal scale. Rather than asking whether two random individuals are separated by a small number of links, we ascertain the extent to which individuals in spe- cific age groups live in a small world in relation to individuals in other generational classes. We observe that the average global distance between any random pair of users is 9.52, corresponding to nine-and- a-half degrees of separation. Age-specific analyses show that there is a systematic variation around this average according age. Young people live in the smallest world, being separated from other young people and their parents generation via a comparatively small num- ber of intermediaries. Older people live in the least small world, being separated from their same age peers and their younger coun- terparts by a relatively large number of intermediaries. All of these age-specific small world effects are the same for men and women. Our results are consistent with well-known social mechanisms af- fecting the way that age interacts with overall volume of connectivity and the relative prevalence of kin ties and non-kin ties, and have significant implications for our understanding of generation-specific dynamics of information cascades, diffusion phenomena, and the spread of fads and fashions."

Given any pair of documents from a (background) document collection, CDA aims to automatically identify sets of quality phrases to summarize the commonalities of both documents and highlight the distinctions of each with respect to the other informatively and concisely. Our solution uses a general graph-based framework to derive novel measures on phrase semantic commonality and pairwise distinction, where the background corpus is used for computing phrase-document semantic relevance. We use the measures to guide the selection of sets of phrases by solving two joint optimization problems. A scalable iterative algorithm is developed to integrate the maximization of phrase commonality or distinction measure with the learning of phrase-document semantic relevance. Experiments on large text corpora from two different domains  scientific papers and news - demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework on comparing documents. Analysis on a 10GB+ text corpus demonstrates the scalability of our method, whose computation time grows linearly as the corpus size increases. Our case study on comparing news articles published at different dates shows the power of the proposed method on comparing sets of documents."

        "abstract": "The availability of geo-annotated social media data in sheer volume sheds light on studying human mobility patterns. Among them, periodic pattern, i.e., an individual visiting different geographical regions with some specific time interval, has been recognized as one of the most important. Mining periodic patterns has a variety of applications, such as location prediction, anomaly detection, as well as location- and time-aware recommendation. However, it is a challenging task: both regions of a person and periods of each region are unknown; the interdependency between them makes it even harder. Also, detecting periods from low-sampling, noisy and short-span social media data remains unsolved in existing studies.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian non-parametric model Periodic REgion Detection (PRED) to discover periodic mobility patterns for individuals by jointly modeling geographical and temporal information. What sets our method apart from previous studies is that PRED not only requires no knowledge about an individuals mobility, such as the number of regions, period lengths, region sizes, etc., but it can also work on GPS coordinates data. When detecting periods, PRED exploits gap time between two consecutive timestamps rather than directly modeling the exact visiting time, so that it is less sensitive to the irregular mobility and low data quality. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that PRED outperforms the state-of-theart baselines significantly in four tasks: periodic region discovery, outlier movement finding, period detection, location prediction."

Moreover, contextual valence shifters may change sentiment polarity depending on the contexts that they appear in. Both challenges cannot be modeled effectively and explicitly in traditional sentiment analysis. Studying both phenomena requires multi- theme sentiment analysis at the word level, which is very interesting but significantly more challenging than overall polarity classification.\n\nTo simultaneously resolve the multi-theme and sentiment shifting problems, we propose a data-driven framework to enable both capabilities: (1) polarity predictions of the same word in reviews of different themes, and (2) discovery and quantification of contextual valence shifters. The framework formulates multi-theme sentiment by factorizing the review sentiments with theme/word embeddings and then derives the shifter effect learning problem as a logistic regression. The improvement of sentiment polarity classification accuracy demonstrates not only the importance of multi-theme and sentiment shifting, but also effectiveness of our framework. Human evaluations and case studies further show the success of multi-theme word sentiment predictions and automatic effect quantification of contextual valence shifters."

The HEBE framework models the proximity among objects in an event by predicting a target object given the other participating objects in the event (hyperedge). Since each hyperedge encapsulates more information on a given event, HEBE is robust to data sparseness. In addition, HEBE is scalable when the data size spirals. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of HEBE."

        "abstract": "Given the large volume of technical documents available, it is crucial to automatically organize and categorize these documents to be able to understand and extract value from them. Towards this end, we introduce a new research problem called Facet Extraction. Given a collection of technical documents, the goal of Facet Extraction is to automatically label each document with a set of concepts for the key facets (e.g., application, technique, evaluation metrics, and dataset) that people may be interested in. Facet Extraction has numerous applications, including document summarization, literature search, patent search and business intelligence. The major challenge in performing Facet Extraction arises from multiple sources: concept extraction, concept to facet matching, and facet disambiguation. To tackle these challenges, we develop FacetGist, a framework for facet extraction. Facet Extraction involves constructing a graph-based heterogeneous network to capture information available across multiple local sentence-level features, as well as global context features. We then formulate a joint optimization problem, and propose an efficient algorithm for graph-based label propagation to estimate the facet of each concept mention. Experimental results on technical corpora from two domains demonstrate that Facet Extraction can lead to an improvement of over 25% in both precision and recall over competing schemes.\n"

        "abstract": "Current models for opinion dynamics typically utilize a Poisson process for speaker selection, making the waiting time between events exponentially distributed. Human interaction tends to be a more bursty process, though, having higher probabilities of either extremely short waiting times or long periods of silence rather than the relative regularity of Poisson selection. To quantify the effects this difference may have on the dynamics of social models, we place in competition two groups exhibiting different speakers' waiting-time distributions. These competitions are implemented in the binary Naming Game and in the voter model, showing that the relevant aspect of the waiting-time distribution is the density of the head rather than that of the tail. In fact, we show that even with identical mean waiting times, a group with a higher density of short waiting times is favored in competition over the group with a less bursty distribution. This effect remains in the presence of nodes holding a single opinion that never changes, as the fraction of such committed individuals necessary for achieving consensus decreases dramatically when their waiting-time distribution has a higher head density than the waiting-time distribution of the nodes holding competing opinions."

        "abstract": "Peer-to-peer lending is hypothesized to help equalize economic opportunities for the world's poor. We empirically investigate the *flat world* hypothesis using crowdfinancing data for over 660,000 loans in 220 countries made between 2005 and 2013. Contrary to the flat world, we find that peer-to-peer lending networks are moving away from flatness. Furthermore, decreasing flatness is strongly associated with multiple variables: Relatively stable patterns in the difference in the per capita GDP between borrowing and lending nations, ongoing migration flows from borrowing to lending nations worldwide, and the existence of a tie as a historic colonial. Our regression analysis also indicates a spatial preference in lending for geographically proximal borrowers. To estimate the robustness for these patterns for future changes, we construct a network of borrower and lending nations based on the observed data. Then, to perturb the network, we stochastically simulate policy and event shocks (e.g., erecting walls) or regulatory shocks (e.g., Brexit). The simulations project a drift towards rather than away from flatness. However, levels of flatness persist only for randomly distributed shocks. By contrast, loss of the top borrowing nations produces more flatness, not less, indicating how the welfare of the overall system is tied to a few distinctive and critical country-pair relationships."

Persistent homology has thus far been primarily used for topological data analysis using a point cloud representation. In contrast, we apply persistent homology on temporal networks, and use it as a tool to compare and contrast between different growing networks. Specifically, we consider two collaboration networks: the paper collaboration network DBLP, and the actor collaboration network IMDB. We compare the evolution of their network properties, and of the homology (Betti numbers) with time. We also compare their topological signatures using persistent homology.We introduce a distance metric for comparing the topological signatures, and using it, visualize the similarity between individual segments through multidimensional scaling. We observe that, while the DBLP network has substantially evolved over time, the nature of collaboration in the IMDB network has relatively remained unchanged over the period 1950-2008. Our work shows that homology-based signatures can be effective in discriminating between real-world networks."

In sharp contrast to classical housing markets, previous studies in multi-type housing markets have been hindered by the lack of natural solution concepts, be- cause the strict core might be empty.\n\nWe break the barrier in the literature by leveraging AI techniques and making natural assumptions on agents preferences. We show that when agents preferences are lexicographic, even with different importance orders, the classical top-trading-cycles mechanism can be extended while preserving most of its nice properties. We also investigate computational complexity of checking whether an allocation is in the strict core and checking whether the strict core is empty. Our results convey an encouragingly positive message: it is possible to design good mechanisms for multi-type housing markets under natural assumptions on preferences."

The developed model reveals that increasing either the network's mean degree or the \\\\choosiness* exercised during pair formation increases the strength of positive assortative mating. That is, we note that attractiveness is correlated among mated nodes. Their total number also increases with mean degree and selectivity during pair formation. By iterating over the model's mapping of parents onto offspring across generations, we study the evolution of attractiveness. Selection mediated by exclusion from reproduction increases mean attractiveness, but is rapidly balanced by skew in the offspring distribution of highly attractive mated pairs."

Typically, control has multiple prerequisites: it requires an accurate map of the network that governs the interactions between the systems components, a quantitative description of the dynamical laws that govern the temporal behavior of each component, and an ability to influence the state and temporal behavior of a selected subset of the components. With deep roots in dynamical systems and control theory, notions of control and controllability have taken a new life recently in the study of complex networks, inspiring several fundamental questions: What are the control principles of complex systems? How do networks organize themselves to balance control with functionality? To address these questions here recent advances on the controllability and the control of complex networks are reviewed, exploring the intricate interplay between the network topology and dynamical laws. The pertinent mathematical results are matched with empirical findings and applications. Uncovering the control principles of\ncomplex systems can help us explore and ultimately govern their behavior."

        "abstract": "When modeling geo-spatial data, it is critical to capture spatial correlations for achieving high accuracy. Spatial Auto-Regression (SAR) is a common tool used to model such data, where the spatial contiguity matrix (W) encodes the spatial correlations. However, the efficacy of SAR is limited by two factors. First, it depends on the choice of contiguity matrix, which is typically not learnt from data, but instead, is assumed to be known apriori. Second, it assumes that the observations can be explained by linear models. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework to model geo-spatial data (specifically housing prices), to learn the spatial correlations automatically. We show that neighborhood information embedded in satellite imagery can be leveraged to achieve the desired spatial smoothing. An additional upside of our framework is the relaxation of linear assumption on the data. Specific challenges we tackle while implementing our framework include, (i) how much of the neighborhood is relevant while estimating housing prices? (ii) what is the right approach to capture multiple resolutions of satellite imagery? and (iii) what other data-sources can help improve the estimation of spatial correlations? We demonstrate a marked improvement of 57% on top of the SAR baseline through the use of features from deep neural networks for the cities of London, Birmingham and Liverpool."

        "abstract": "We propose a bilinear model for processing multimodal data using a deep neural network architecture. The  multimodal data includes low resolution videos and associated seismic sensor time sequence data that captures targets, such as people, moving in the sensor field. We consider the problem of detecting moving targets in this sensor\nfield. The camera sensors have overlapping field of view with the seismic sensors, and in general may cover more than one seismic sensor. The primary challenge is to work with the low resolution videos that have fewer than 50 pixels on the objects of interest. The proposed approach consists of deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) that\nare first trained on the individual sensor modalities. The bilinear model consists of taking the vector outer product of\nthe resulting CNN descriptors that maintain the spatial and temporal localization information implicit in the individual\nCNN outputs. We propose a pooling method to further compress the resulting large dimensional feature vectors from\nthe vector outer product. This is followed by a final training step where a 3D CNN is trained for detection. Experimental\nresults demonstrate a significant performance enhancement in fusing the multimodal data."

        "abstract": "\nVarious types of leadership have been discussed in the literature by emphasizing a leaders unique traits that can effectively stimulate followers capability. However, little has considered efficient management in terms of a leaders resource availability where the leader needs to make decisions under time pressure or cognitive limitation. This study mainly focuses on developing a cognitive decision making tool to achieve a cost-effective decision in the context of a leader-follower situation. We study the issue of an effective and efficient leadership in providing feedback aiming to maximize a followers capability while minimizing resource consumption such as an amount of feedback. To this end, we propose a situational leadership framework that provides decisions for: (1) whether to provide feedback to a follower with a different level of performance readiness; and (2) how much feedback should be provided to maximize decision utility that considers both a followers growth and resource consumption. In this work, we adopt an instance-based learning theory (IBLT) and apply the concept of trust to characterize a followers performance traits in IBL. To evaluate the effect of the proposed framework under different types of a follower, we model a followers performance readiness based on a leaders trust in the follower. We compare our proposed IBL decision framework with rule-based counterparts. In both schemes, we also examine the impact of using trust in decision making process. We discuss when IBL-based decision is more beneficial than rule-based counterpart under a different level of resource availability a leader has. Further, we examine when trust-based decisions are more useful than non-trust-based decisions in maximizing decision performance under either an IBL-based or rule-based scheme. Decision performance is evaluated in terms of feedback cost, decision utility, and trust improvement of a follower under varying key design parameters."

The approach is language-agnostic and thus broadly\napplicable to global and multilingual media. In cases of conflict,\ndispute, or situations involving multiple  parties with contrasting\ninterests, opinions get divided into different camps. Previous\nmanual inspection of tweets has shown that such situations produce\ndistinguishable signatures on Twitter, as people take sides leading\nto clusters that preferentially propagate information confirming\ntheir individual cluster-specific bias.

In turn,  identifying such clusters\noffers insights into prevalent social conflicts and helps automate\nthe generation of less biased descriptions of ongoing events. We\nevaluate our factorization algorithms and their results on multiple\nTwitter datasets involving polarization of opinions, demonstrating\nthe efficacy of our approach. Experiments show that our method is\nalmost always correct in identifying the polarized information from\nreal-world twitter traces, and outperforms the baseline mechanisms\nby a large margin.\n"

We investigate how people might learn about social dilemmas by studying how simulated\nplayers using a cognitive model known as instance-based learning (IBL) interact with each other and with a set of fixed strategies in the Prisoners Dilemma (PD). The current simulation study presents systematic variations in the payoff structure and the other players strategy.

Users were allowed to freely interact with a simple browser or a tool that provided automated recommendations. Our analysis produced three novel findings: 1) objective measurement of user understanding of the algorithm, cognitive reflection, and domain knowledge helped to explain an additional 40% of variance (R2) for decision outcomes over a subjective user experience model, 2) user understanding of the recommendation algorithm was the strongest predictor that recommendations would be accepted, and 3) a statistical model showed 11% reduction in knowledge of the underlying dataset for those who interacted heavily with the recommender system."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and implemen- tation of Athena, an information delivery service for disaster response. Athena is novel in that it directly optimizes the efficiency of decision making, as opposed to only focusing on traditional, lower-level communication optimizations, such as total network throughput or average latency. Specifically, by using a decision-making model, our algorithms prioritize data transmission and caching to minimize overhead of transferring information needed by a variety of decision makers. Athena views decisions as choices of a course of action, based on several logical predicates. Making a decision is reduced to evaluating a Boolean expression on these predicates; for example, if it is raining, I will carry an umbrella. To evaluate a predicate, evidence is needed (e.g., a picture of the weather). Data objects, retrieved from sensors, supply the needed evidence for predicate evaluation. The decision-making problem is thus reduced to one of delivering the right evidence to the decision maker and caching the results of predicate evaluation, while fresh, to facilitate future decisions. We present our system architecture, discuss its key design choices, and evaluate it through an array of experiments over emulated networks with realistic settings. Results show that Athena improves the efficiency of information gathering and delivery in support of post-disaster situation assessment and decision making in the face of various environmental and systems constraints."

Despite extensive investigation into various factors that influence a scientists choice of research topics quantitative assessments of mechanisms that give rise to macroscopic patterns characterizing research-interest evolution of individual scientists remain limited. Here we perform a large-scale analysis of publication records, and we show that changes in research interests follow a reproducible pattern characterized by an exponential distribution. We identify three fundamental features responsible for the observed exponential distribution, which arise from a subtle interplay between exploitation and exploration in research-interest evolution. We developed a random-walk-based model, allowing us to accurately reproduce the empirical observations. This work uncovers and quantitatively analyses macroscopic patterns that govern changes in research interests, thereby showing that there is a high degree of regularity underlying scientific research and individual careers."

Using SCOPUS and PubMed databases we have identified clusters of publications resulting from research areas and collaboration between countries. Based on the collaboration patterns, areas of research and their evolution over the past 35 years, we combined different methods in order to understand evolution in science. The methods took into consideration descriptive network analysis combined with lexical analysis of publications, and the collaboration patterns represented by links in network structure. The methods used country of the authors publications, MeSH terms, and the  collaboration patterns in seven five-year period collaboration network and publication networks snapshots as attributes. The results show that network analysis metrics can bring evidences of evolution of collaboration between different research groups within a specific research area and that those areas have subnetworks that influence collaboration structures and focus."

We will call these systems that support people in making choices and decisions artificial advice givers (AAGs): They propose and evaluate options while involving their human users in the decision-making process. This special issue addresses the challenge of improving the interaction between artificial and human agents. It answers the question of how an agent of each type (human and artificial) can influence and understand the reasoning, working models, and conclusions of the other agent by means of novel forms of interaction. To address this challenge, the articles in the special issue are organized around three themes: (a) human factors to consider when designing interactions with AAGs (e.g., over- and under-reliance, overestimation of the systems capabilities), (b) methods for supporting interaction with AAGs (e.g., natural language, visualization, and argumentation), and (c) considerations for evaluating AAGs (both criteria and methodology for applying them)."

        "abstract": "Bias is a common problem in todays media, appearing fre- quently in text and in visual imagery. Users on social media websites such as Twitter need better methods for identifying bias. Additionally, activists, those who are motivated to effect change related to some topic, need better methods\nto identify and counteract bias that is contrary to their mis- sion. With both of these use-cases in mind, in this paper we propose a novel tool called UnbiasedCrowd that supports identification of, and action against bias in visual media.\nIn particular, it addresses the following key challenges (1) identification of bias; (2) aggregation and presentation of evidence to users; (3) enabling activists to inform the pub- lic of bias by engaging them in conversation with chat-bots. We describe a preliminary study on the Twitter platform that explores the impressions that activists had of our tool, and how crowds reacted and engaged with online bots that exposed visual bias. We conclude by discussing design and implication of our findings for creating future systems to identify and counteract the effects of news bias.\n"

        "abstract": "The sparsest cut problem consists of identifying a small set of edges that breaks the graph into balanced sets of vertices. The normalized cut problem balances the total degree, instead of the size, of the resulting sets. Applications of graph cuts include community detection and computer vision. However, cut problems were originally proposed for static graphs, an assumption that does not hold in many modern applications where graphs are highly dynamic. In this paper, we introduce the sparsest and normalized cut problems in temporal graphs, which generalize their standard definitions by enforcing the smoothness of cuts over time. We propose novel formulations and algorithms for computing temporal cuts using spectral graph theory, multiplex graphs, divide-and-conquer and low-rank matrix approximation. Furthermore, we extend our formulation to dynamic graph signals, where cuts also capture node values, as graph wavelets. Experiments show that our solutions are accurate and scalable, enabling the discovery of dynamic communities and the analysis of dynamic graph processes."

        "abstract": "Public data uploaded to social networks can be thought of as a signal that reflects conditions of the physical world. The social signal in question acts as a novel sensing modality, not unlike acoustic, vibration, or magnetic sensing. Much the way physical objects induce distinguishable signals in their physical environment that can be detected by observing the physical medium, socially relevant events (such as car accidents, attacks, fires, natural disasters, anomalous events, parades, or protests) induce distinguishable signals in their social environment that can be detected by observing the social media. On physical media, signals from multiple objects are mixed as they impinge upon the sensor. These signals can be separated via an appropriate source separation or data association method, such as demultiplexing or band filtering. In social sensing, social signals emitted in response to events play the role of physical signals emitted from objects. A challenge lies in separating out the information bits about a single event from other information bits about other events. In that sense, the separation algorithm acts as a demultiplexor in electronic systems. The chapter describes recent progress in exploiting the social modality of sensing, motivated by the significant popularity and growth of modern social networks. Examples of extracting information from Twitter and Instagram are provided.\n"

        "abstract": "Some of the most widely deployed IoT devices in urban areas are smart phones in the possession of urban individuals. Their proliferation has led to the emergence of crowdsensing/crowdsourcing services, where humans collect data about their environment (using phones), and servers aggregate the data for various application purposes of interest. With the emergence of social media, a common alternative form of human data entry has become media posts (e.g., on Twitter). This leads to the prospect of building crowdsensing services on top of social media content, exploiting humans as sensors. In this paper, we develop one such service, called StoryLine. The service detects and tracks physical urban events of interest to the user, such as car accidents, infrastructure damage (in the aftermath of a natural disaster), or instances of civil unrest. It offers an interface to client-side software that allows browsing such events in real time, as well as an interface for software applications to a structured representation of the events and their related statistics. The service embodies novel algorithms for real-time detection, demultiplexing, and tracking of physical events using social media data. In our evaluation with Twitter feeds, we show that our service outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines in event detection and demultiplexing. We also conduct two case studies to show the effectiveness of the real-time event detection capability and event tracking performance of our system.\n"

        "abstract": "This paper describes characteristics of information flow on social channels, as a function of content type and relations among individual sources, distilled from analysis of Twitter data as well as human subject survey results. The working hypothesis is that individuals who propagate content on social media media act (e.g., decide whether to relay information or not) in accordance with their understanding of the content, as well as their own beliefs and trust relations. Hence, the resulting aggregate content propagation pattern encodes the collective content interpretation of the underlying group, as well as their relations. Analysis algorithms are described to recover such relations from the observed propagation patterns as well as improve our understanding of the content itself in a language agnostic manner simply from its propagation characteristics. An example is to measure the degree of community polarization around contentious topics, identify the factions involved, and recognize their individual views on issues. The analysis is independent of the language of discourse itself, making it valuable for multilingual media, where the number of languages used may render language-specific analysis less scalable. "

        "abstract": "This paper develops an algorithm that exploits picture-oriented social networks to localize urban events. We choose picture-oriented networks because taking a picture requires physical proximity, thereby revealing the location of the photographed event. Furthermore, most modern cell phones are equipped with GPS, making picture location, and time metadata commonly available. We consider Instagram as the social network of choice and limit ourselves to urban events (noting that the majority of the world population lives in cities). The paper introduces a new adaptive localization algorithm that does not require the user to specify manually tunable parameters. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm for various real-world datasets, comparing it against a few baseline methods. The results show that our method achieves the best recall, the fewest false positives, and the lowest average error in localizing urban events."

        "abstract": "To systematically analyze large numbers of textual documents, it is often desirable to manage documents (and their metadata) in a multi-dimensional text database (Text Cube). Such structure provides flexibility of understanding local information with different granularities. Moreover, the contextualized analysis derived from cube structure often yields comparative insights. To quickly digest the content of subsets of documents in the multi-dimensional context, we study the problem of phrase-based summarization of a subset of documents of interest. We propose a new phrase ranking measure to leverage the relation between document subsets induced by multi-dimensional context and identify phrases that truly distinguish the queried subset of documents from neighboring subsets (i.e., background). Our quality evaluation suggests the new measure involving dynamic, query-dependent background generation is more effective than previous measures using the whole corpus as a static background for finding representative phrases. Computing this measure is more expensive due to the need of access to many subsets of documents to answer one query. We develop a cube-based analytical platform that implements an efficient solution by materializing a deliberately selected part of statistics, and using these statistics to perform online query processing within a constant latency constraint. Our experiments in a large news dataset demonstrate the efficiency in both query processing time and storage cost."

        "abstract": "The availability of massive geo-annotated social media data sheds light on studying human mobility patterns. Among them, periodic pattern, i.e., an individual visiting a geographical region with some specific time interval, has been recognized as one of the most important. Mining periodic patterns has a variety of applications, such as location prediction, anomaly detection, and location- and time-aware recommendation. However, it is a challenging task: the regions of a person and the periods of each region are both unknown. The interdependency between them makes the task even harder. Hence, existing methods are far from satisfactory for detecting periodic patterns from the low-sampling and noisy social media data. We propose a Bayesian non-parametric model, named Periodic REgion Detection (PRED), to discover periodic mobility patterns by jointly modeling the geographical and temporal information. Our method differs from previous studies in that it is non-parametric and thus does not require priori knowledge about an individuals mobility (e.g., number of regions, period length, region size). Meanwhile, it models the time gap between two consecutive records rather than the exact visit time, making it less sensitive to data noise. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and realworld datasets show that PRED outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in four tasks: periodic region discovery, outlier movement finding, period detection, and location prediction."

        "abstract": "With the ever-increasing urbanization process, systematically modeling peoples activities in the urban space is being recognized as a crucial socioeconomic task. is task was nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of reliable data sources, yet the emergence of geo-tagged social media (GTSM) data sheds new light on it. Recently, there have been fruitful studies on discovering geographical topics from GTSM data. However, their high computational costs and strong distributional assumptions about the latent topics hinder them from fully unleashing the power of GTSM. To bridge the gap, we present CrossMap, a novel cross-modal representation learning method that uncovers urban dynamics with massive GTSM data. CrossMap rst employs an accelerated mode seeking procedure to detect spatiotemporal hotspots underlying peoples activities. ose detected hotspots not only address spatiotemporal variations, but also largely alleviate the sparsity of the GTSM data. With the detected hotspots, CrossMap then jointly embeds all spatial, temporal, and textual units into the same space using two dierent strategies: one is reconstructionbased and the other is graph-based. Both strategies capture the correlations among the units by encoding their co-occurrence and neighborhood relationships, and learn low-dimensional representations to preserve such correlations. Our experiments demonstrate that CrossMap not only signicantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for activity recovery and classication, but also achieves much beer eciency."

        "abstract": "Given a complicated problem that requires different expertise types, our goal is to quickly assemble a team of experts who can collaboratively solve the problem. We assume that assembling a team requires the search of a social network. Our proposed solution toward this goal is an agent-based simulation model. The model investigates collaborative network search to assemble problem-solving teams of experts. Collaborative network search incorporates the collaboration of experts during a network search. We compare the performance of three canonical search strategies relying on differing levels of network knowledge. The performance of these strategies for collaborative network search display a key trade-off to consider when implementing search. Depending on the structure of a network, strategies that require more information may not noticeably perform better than other less information-intensive strategies. In general, strategies that require more information are more robust to changes in network structure than strategies with low information requirements. From the simulations, we learn that search strategies with low information requirements tend to fail more often than those requiring more information, but successful searches complete efficiently and comparably among all strategies under certain network topologies. Our results suggest that collaborative network search strategies perform comparably, and assembling teams is efficient regardless of the information requirement of different search strategies. "

We characterize the computational complexity of computing the loss of a given outcome and computing the outcomes with minimum loss for three natural loss functions: 0-1 loss, neighborhood loss, and global loss. While the optimal decision is NP-hard to compute for many cases, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the optimal decision for tree-structured PCP-nets and profiles of CP-net preferences with a shared dependency structure, w.r.t. neighborhood loss function."

Through the introduction of a diffusion-convolution operation, we show how diffusion-based representations can be learned from graph structured data and used as an effective basis for node classification. DCNNs have several attractive qualities, including a latent representation for graphical data that\nis invariant under isomorphism, as well as polynomial-time prediction and learning that can be represented as tensor operations and efficiently implemented on a GPU. Through several experiments with real structured datasets, we demonstrate that DCNNs are able to outperform probabilistic relational models and kernel-on-graph methods at relational node classification tasks."

        "abstract": "Lossy communication of correlated sources over a multiple access channel is studied. First, lossy communication is investigated in the presence of correlated decoder side information. An achievable joint source-channel coding scheme is presented, and the conditions under which separate source and channel coding is optimal are explored. It is shown that separation is optimal when the encoders and the decoder have access to a common observation conditioned on which the two sources are independent. Separation is shown to be optimal also when only the encoders have access to such a common observation whose lossless recovery is required at the decoder. Moreover, the optimality of separation is shown for sources with a common part, and sources with reconstruction constraints. Next, these results obtained for the system in presence of side information are utilized to provide a set of necessary conditions for the transmission of correlated sources over a multiple access channel without side information. The identified necessary conditions are specialized to the case of bivariate Gaussian sources over a Gaussian multiple access channel, and are shown to be tighter than known results in the literature in certain cases. Our results indicate that side information can have a significant impact on the optimality of source-channel separation in lossy transmission, in addition to being instrumental in identifying necessary conditions for the transmission of correlated sources when no side information is present.

        "abstract": "Urban anomalies such as live condition complains (e.g., noise) and infrastructure malfunctions (e.g., pothole reports) negatively affect the urban environment and need to be addressed timely to minimize the negative impact. A number of urban sensing-based anomaly reporting systems have been developed to enable pervasive and real-time reporting of anomalies in cities. While significant research work have been made in anomaly detection based on the reporting systems, urban anomaly prediction, largely underestimated the importance in urban computing, received less attention.  Accurate prediction of urban anomalies in all regions of the city can great help the government and communities respond or prevent urban anomalies more efficiently. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework, Anomaliy Prediction based on Urban Data (APUD), that accurately predicts which regions in a city will have anomalies as well as the exact number of anomalies in each region in the next time slot. Finally, we perform extensive analysis to evaluate our framework with different region scales on two real-world datasets collected from Pittsburgh and New York City respectively. The evaluation results demonstrate that our scheme can predict different categories of anomalies more accurately compared to the state-of-the-art baselines."

        "abstract": "Images/videos are often uploaded in situations like disasters. This can tax the network in terms of increased load and thereby upload latency, and this can be critical for response activities. In such scenarios, prior work has shown that there is significant redundancy in the content (e.g., similar photos taken by users) transferred. By intelligently suppressing/deferring transfers of redundant content, the load can be significantly reduced, thereby facilitating the timely delivery of unique, possibly critical information. A key challenge here however, is detecting what content is similar, given that the content is generated by uncoordinated user devices. Towards addressing this challenge, we propose a framework, wherein a service to which the content is to be uploaded first solicits metadata (e.g., image features) from any device uploading content. By intelligently comparing this metadata with that associated with previously uploaded content, the service effectively identifies (and thus enables the suppression of) redundant content. Our evaluations on a testbed of 20 Android smartphones and via ns3 simulations show that we can identify similar content with a 70% true positive rate and a 1% false positive rate. The resulting reduction in redundant content transfers translates to a latency reduction of 44 % for unique content."

        "abstract": "Wireless cameras can be used to gather situation awareness information (e.g., humans in distress) in disaster recovery scenarios. However, blindly sending raw video streams from such cameras, to an operations center or controller can be prohibitive in terms of bandwidth. Further, these raw streams could contain either redundant or irrelevant information. Thus, we ask how do we extract accurate situation awareness infor- mation from such camera nodes and send it in a timely manner, back to the operations center? Towards this, we design ACTION, a framework that (a) detects objects of interest (e.g., humans) from the video streams, (b) combines these streams intelligently to eliminate redundancies and (c) transmits only parts of the feeds that are sufficient in achieving a desired detection accuracy to the controller. ACTION uses small amounts of metadata to determine if the objects from different camera feeds are the same. A resource-aware greedy algorithm is used to select a subset of video feeds that are associated with the same object, so as to provide a desired accuracy, for being sent to the operations center. Our evaluations show that ACTION helps reduce the network usage up to threefold, and yet achieves a high detection accuracy of  90%."

        "abstract": "A wireless camera network can provide situation awareness information (e.g., humans in distress) in scenarios such as disaster recovery. If such camera sensors are battery operated, sending raw video feeds back to a central controller can be expensive in terms of energy consumption. Further, if all cameras were to use the optimal processing algorithm for object decision, they may also expend unnecessary energy. Stated otherwise, cameras that capture the same objects may not all have to use the optimal algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy, and this can save processing energy costs. In this paper, our objective is to design and implement a framework that can support co- ordination among cameras to deliver highly accurate detection of objects in an energy efficient way. The framework, which we call EECS (for energy efficient camera sensors), estimates the detection accuracy and energy costs incurred (both the processing and communication costs are taken into account) with each detection algorithm for each camera, and comes up with a choice of cameras for sending information pertaining to the object of interest. This set of cameras and the video processing algorithms that they must use, are chosen so as to minimize the energy expenditures, given a desired detection accuracy. We implement EECS on a camera network built with smartphones, and demonstrate that it reduces the energy consumption by up to 40% while ensuring a object detection accuracy of over 86%."

        "abstract": "The ``business elite'' constitutes a small but strikingly influential subset of the population, oftentimes affecting important societal outcomes such as the consolidation of political power, the adoption of corporate governance practices, and the stability of national economies more broadly. While there is general awareness that connections among the business elite arise because ``elites attend the same schools, belong to the same clubs, and in general are in the same place at the same time'', surprisingly little is known about the network dynamics that emerge within these formative settings.  We examine how the initial ties in a network of elites can predict the final network structure and professional success of elites.  Here we analyze a unique dataset of all MBA students at a top 5 MBA program. Students were randomly assigned to their first classes; friendship among students prior to coming into the program was rare; and the network data  email transmissions among students  were collected for the year 2006 when students almost entirely used the school's email server to communicate, thereby providing an excellent proxy for their networks. After matching students on all available characteristics (e.g., age, grade scores, industry experience, etc.)  i.e. creating ``twin pairs''  we find that the distinguishing characteristics between students who do well in job placement and those who do not is their network. Further, we find that the network differences between the successful and unsuccessful students develops within the first month of class and persists thereafter, suggesting a network imprinting that is persistent. Finally, we find that these effects are pronounced for students who are at the extreme ends of the distribution on other measures of success  students with the best expected job placement do particularly poorly without the right network (``descenders''), whereas students with worst expected job placement pull themselves to the top of the placement hierarchy (``ascenders'') with the right network."

Using a dramatically more comprehensive dataset on global terrorism than previously available, we find that the distribution of the severity of attacks does not conform to power laws distributions when looked at over time, 1970 to today, and when further decomposed into national and international terrorist network. Specifically, we find that a power law has limited explanatory power about the global-scale terrorist attacks and its application is context dependent. While the severity of attacks carried out by international groups may follow a power law, domestic groups appear to follow an exponential distribution which lacks the same underlying mechanism. This suggests that governmental efforts and targeting practices should change given the nature of the group involved."

Little is known about women in STEM leadership positions despite the key role leaders have in hiring, promotion, and job culture. We study the link between graduate school networks and job placement in STEM. Our data covers two cohorts of students in a graduate program designed to place students in STEM leadership positions.  Using their e-communication records, we focus on the structure and composition of their networks and their job placement and find three key results. (1) In terms of network structure, successful men and women are similar; their PageRank in the school wide network is positively associated with better job placement. (2) Despite a common network structure of success, the composition and communication dynamics of mens and womens inner circles differ markedly.  Men place better when they equally spread their communication time (measured as Shannon Entropy) across their contacts.  Further, they place no better or no worse if their connections are all-male or all-female. By contrast, women differ in terms of communication equality and gender balance.  The more women communicate unequally -- with proportionately more attention given to the women in their network, the more positive their job success. Further, women in networks of mostly men have a significantly below average placement while women who have more women than male network contacts place better. (3) Mens and womens networks emerge in a relative instant  in the first 30 days of class. This initial structure then persists throughout matriculation, highlighting the enduring effects of social networks on job placement. The striking findings in the composition and communication patterns of men and women in relation to job success help identify the critical and actionable differences in mens and womens networks and their role in gender stratification, peer mentoring, and the inner circle of women and men."

        "abstract": "We present a new framework for explaining and predicting the severity of terrorist attacks, an area of nascent scientific research.  Our framework predicts the turning point of a terrorist group from low to high lethality and the severity of the most lethal attack using knowledge of a groups timing of attacks and time between attacks.  \nTo position our framework, we (1) go beyond prior work that has used small, convenience samples of terrorism.  Using a comprehensive dataset on global terrorism (last 45 yrs & 140,000 events), we show that data reject the conclusion that terrorist attacks are power law distributed when examined temporally or at different levels of national or international analysis.  (2) Our framework incorporates a new metric, which compares the timing of a terrorists groups attack to what is expected by chance.  This metric permits us to identify the turning point in a terrorist groups lifespan from low lethality to high lethality. When terrorist groups act randomly with respect to time, their lethality is low but the more they behave in a non-random fashion, the greater their lethality.  (3) We formulate a two parameter model that predicts turning points. One parameter measures how lethal a group is relative to the average lethality and the other parameters measures the groups burstiness of attacks.  The model is innovative and valuable in that it (a) makes predictions based on generic and easily updated temporal information, (b) reduces the need for knowledge of idiosyncratic political, religious, or economics factors, and (c) accurately makes group level predictions.\n"

        "abstract": "The passing on of knowledge from age bracket to age bracket has created greater complexity of scientific bloodline networks during human evolution. Mentorship plays a key role in knowledge heredity, while the subtle relationship between mentor and mentee still remains unrevealed. The sufficient data records from the Mathematics Genealogy Project, which documents the mathematicians tracing back to one century, and also the big scientific corpus, Web of Science, give us the chance to create a unique network including more than 25,000 mentors/mentees and their publication records, which makes it possible to answer the big question: Whats the role of mentor in a mentees scientific performance? We define the scientific performance of each mathematician using the citations of his/her paper list, and analyze the results by the help of linear regression with fixed effect and some statistical methods. We found interesting results: On the one hand, the scientific performance of mentors and mentees in mentorship network are highly correlated (Fig. 1A&1B) when fixing other factors such as the graduation years, the graduation universities, the team size, the number of students etc. On the other hand, a mentors mentoring ability has an increasing trend through a mentors career (Fig. 1C) with three turning points (Fig. 1D), which roughly correspond to the mentors ages of getting tenured (39.8), lifetime achievement (49.4), and retirement (55.1). Our results offer strong implications: for mentors to plan their career, for PhD students to select befitting mentors, and also potential guide to science policy."

By exploring the data, we found that, at first, the universities can be classified into hierarchies according to their scientific performance, and the underling pipeline network exists between specific universities where the talent flow are larger than expectation (Fig. 1A); Secondly, the mobility of mathematician follows the gravity law, and the movements are more likely to occur between universities in the same stratification (Fig. 1B); Lastly, the mathematicians performance is well classified by the hierarchy of universities: mathematicians in the same stratifications perform similar, regardless of the difference of their graduation universities, while perform differently when in the different levels of universities (Fig. 1C) and furthermore, for the same mentors who move from elite to low hierarchical university, their students performance also has a significant decrease before and after the mentors move and vice versus from low to elite universities (Fig. 1D).

The limited empirical research on gender differences and creativity does not clearly support this claim, and our research explores the possible differences in creativity between men and women in the context of popular music by operationalizing and comparing measures of (or proxies for) creativity in both music production and consumption.\n\nFor production, we use song and artist metadata from the Echonest and MusicBrainz databases to compare male and female musical artists with respect to the novelty of the songs they create, their collaboration networks, and their propensity to span genres. For consumption, we utilize a dataset of complete listening histories and social relationships for over 144,000 users of the social music service Last.fm. We examine differences in diversity of listening preferences, propensity for discovery (i.e. who are the early adopters of newly released music?), and co-listening-derived user similarity networks (see figure). Early results suggest that males tend to have more diverse listening preferences, but female producers are more likely to generate novel songs.\n"

Understanding how scientific disciplines are established, grow, and decline is not only a fundamental question in scientometrics on the organization of knowledge, but also carries practical significance for universities, funding agencies, and researchers. While a large body of work has explored this question theoretically, or by examining citation or collaboration networks, there has been comparatively little effort to understand how the dynamics of scientific fields are encoded in the actual content, i.e. the text, of published papers.\n\nIn this work we apply information theoretic and machine learning methods to more than 106 abstracts spanning 25 years from the Web of Science database. We show how trends in the growth of scientific disciplines (as measured by, e.g., the total number of publications or authors working in the field) can be followed by looking at statistics of word usage in the publications of these fields. In particular, i) we track entropy changes and divergence measures between the word probability distributions associated with a given field each year to quantify semantic similarity as well as diversity; and ii) we develop textual similarity networks of abstracts (see figure) to track and visualize how the papers associated with a given field move through the latent semantic space over time.\n"

These beliefs about right and wrong vary widely between individuals, contexts, and cultures; but it is thought that they are actually governed by one or more core, latent moral constructs. While there is evidence that these underlying latent constructs are reflected in natural language, this hypothesis requires further testing. In the current research, we demonstrate that the structure of moral values in natural discourse can be modeled using distributed representations of morally relevant terms. We show that distributed representations learned by a neural network can be used to estimate latent factor models and we report three studies validating this approach. In Study 1, we provide a minimum-threshold demonstration that indicates that robust latent constructs can be estimated from the covariance of distributed representations of construct exemplars. In Study 2, we use this approach to test whether the structure proposed by Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) is reflected in natural language. Finally, in Study 3, we conduct a bottom-up investigation of the structure of moral values in natural language using free-response data reported by study participants. Ultimately, we find evidence that the representation of moral values in natural language at least partially corresponds to the structure proposed by MFT. Further, this approach appears to offer a promising framework for validating contemporary language-based measures and models of moral values as well as informing how they can be improved.  "

Also, crowdsourcing activities can be more productive and useful as the percentage of citizens using this technology increases. We discuss a recent experiment using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to investigate social bias factors associated with information transmission. 759 participants shared their social media usage characteristics as a feature of that study, and we explore those data in this paper to consider social media uses for HADR scenarios.

        "abstract": "Predicting the popularity of online content in social networks is important in many applications, ranging from ad campaign designing, web content caching and prefetching, to web-search result ranking. Earlier studies target this problem by learning models that either generalize behaviors of the entire network population or capture behaviors of each individual user. In this paper, we claim that a novel approach based on group-level popularity is necessary and more practical, given the observation that users naturally organize themselves into clusters and that users within a cluster react to online content in a uniform manner. We develop a novel framework by first grouping users into cohesive clusters, and then adopt tensor decomposition to make predictions. In order to minimize the impact of noisy data and be more flexible in capturing changes in users interests, our framework exploits both the network topology and interaction among users in learning a robust user clustering. The PARAFAC tensor decomposition is adapted to work with hierarchical constraint over user groups, and we show that optimizing this constrained function via gradient descent achieves faster convergence and leads to more stable solutions. Extensive experimental results over two social networks demonstrate that our framework is scalable, finds meaningful user groups, and significantly outperforms eight baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy.\n"

We develop two novel scalable representation learning models, namely metapath2vec and metapath2vec++. The metapath2vec model formalizes meta-path based random walks to construct the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node and then leverages a heterogeneous skip-gram model to perform node embeddings. The metapath2vec++ model further enables the simultaneous modeling of structural and semantic correlations in heterogeneous networks. Extensive experiments show that metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ are able to not only outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as node classification, clustering, and similarity search, but also discern the structural and semantic correlations between diverse network objects."

The underlying information propagation topology, however, is often hidden or incomplete because of the lack of explicit citations of the sources. We proposed a scalable parallel algorithm to derive the node embedding to better understand the information dissemination patterns and predict emergent cascades of viral events in online media. Unlike previous works which concentrate on modeling the links of information propagation, our algorithm infers the topic-specific output influence and the input selectivity of nodes. The parallel algorithm iteratively merges local node embedding in particular communities to obtain the global optimal results so that the processing of cascades can be significantly accelerated. Based on the obtained latent representation of nodes, the emergent cascades of viral news events in online media can be successfully predicted with an 80% accuracy at its early stage. Experimental results show that our parallel inference algorithm achieves a 50-fold speedup and requires a low communication overhead, while the accuracy of the cascade size prediction is preserved."

RFID technology and participatory sensing based approaches have offered solutions but often their adoption was limited due to the high hardware costs or low active participation problem. With the introduction of iBeacon technology and smartphones having BLE capability, tracking such objects has become easier and cost-effective. Objects of care are labeled by attaching to them affordable iBeacon tags, and smartphones in the proximity of these tags sense their presence opportunistically through the applications running in the background. In this paper, we study the tracking of lost objects through the collaboration among users. We analyze the visit patterns of users at the same locations and develop a metric that quantifies for each user the potential benefit of others in terms of their capability of finding that users lost objects. Depending on the predicted benefits, each users preference list of other users is formed and then utilized to identify the space buddies who can best track her lost items. The identification is based on the adaption of the solution to the roommate matching problem. We apply the proposed system to two different location based social network datasets and show its effectiveness in different settings."

To the collaborative network, this means that\nif a group of individuals are collaborating, then all subsets of\nthat group are collaborators as well.\nOur main objective is to explore ways to guide the evolution of\na collaborative network if one has specific design goals in mind\nthat are believed to be essential to the collaboration. For instance,\none might wish to have a network that is well connected or does\nnot overload its participants with too many tasks, just to name\ntwo plausible desired properties. To that end, can we determine\nwhether new changes in the collaboration structure are beneficial\nor detrimental to those goals?\nPreviously, the authors proposed several metrics for measuring\nstrength that assign a real-valued score based on the networks\nstructural properties (such as the number of teams an individual\nis part of and the size of the teams). We utilize those metrics as\nwell as other network properties (such as the average or maximum\nteam size, degree, the number of connected components) to\nguide an evolutionary process of collaborative network formation.\nBy simulating this evolutionary process, we identify the effects\nof each metric, the qualities and structural properties it promotes,\nand propose specific recommendations for new collaborations\nthat would lead to desirable network structure.\n"

        "abstract": "Most risk analysis models systematically underestimate the probability and impact of catastrophic events (e.g., economic crises, natural disasters, and terrorism) by not taking into account interconnectivity and interdependence of risks. To address this weakness, the Cascading Alternating Renewal Process (CARP) model is used to forecast interconnected global risks. However, assessments of the models prediction precision are limited for lack of sufficient ground truth data. Here, we demonstrate how to establish the prediction precision using alternative long ground truth data generated by simulations of the CARP model with known parameters. We illustrate the approach on a model of fires in artificial cities assembled from basic city blocks with diverse housing. The results confirm that parameter recovery variance exhibits power law decay as a function of the length of available ground truth data. Using this approach we estimate the real-world prediction precision for the global risk model based on the World Economic Forum Global Risk Report. We conclude that the CARP model is an efficient method for predicting catastrophic cascading events with potential applications to emerging local and global risks."

These studies, however, have not generally analyzed how external events are associated with a social networks structure and communicative properties. Here, we study how external events are associated with a networks change in structure and communications. Analyzing a complete dataset of millions of instant messages among the decision-makers in a large hedge fund and their network of hundreds of outside contacts, we investigate the link between price shocks, network structure, and change in the affect and cognition of decision-makers embedded in the network. When price shocks occur the communication\nnetwork tends not to display structural changes associated with adaptiveness. Rather, the network turtlesup. It displays a propensity for higher clustering, strong tie interaction, and an intensification of insider vs. outsider\ncommunication. Further, we find changes in network structure predict shifts in cognitive and affective processes, execution of new transactions, and local optimality of transactions better than prices, revealing the important predictive relationship between network structure and collective behavior within a social network."

        "abstract": "We study the relationship between chatter on social media and observed actions concerning charitable donation. One hypothesis is that a fraction of those who act will also tweet about it, implying a linear relation. However, if the contagion is present, we expect a superlinear scaling. We consider two scenarios: donations in response to a natural disaster, and regular donations. We empirically validate the model using two location-paired sets of social media and donation data, corresponding to the two scenarios. Results show a quadratic relation between chatter and action in emergency response case. In case of regular donations, we observe a near-linear relation. Additionally, regular donations can be explained by demographic factors, while for a disaster response social media is a much better predictor of action. A contagion model is used to predict the near-quadratic scaling for the disaster response case. This suggests that diffusion is present in emergency response case, while regular charity does not spread via social network. Understanding the scaling behavior that relates social media chatter to physical actions is an important step in estimating the extent of a response and for determining social media strategies to affect the response."

However, current researches on the\ncapacity of wireless ad hoc networks with caching generally\nassume that content popularity follows uniform distribution.\nThey ignore the fact that contents in reality have skewed\npopularity, which may lead to totally different capacity results.\nIn this paper, we evaluate how the distribution of the content\npopularity affects the network capacity, and derive different\ncapacity scaling laws based on the skewness of the content\npopularity.

        "abstract": "In many deployments of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the primary goal is to collect and deliver data from many nodes to a data sink. This goal must be met while considering limited resources, such as battery life, in the wireless nodes. In this work, we propose considering the content of generated data and nodes available channel rates to make intelligent and energy-efficient data selection decisions. We present and provide solutions for maximizing coverage with individual node cost constraints every time slot and  finding the optimal long-term coverage subject to average cost constraints, using Lyapunov Optimization techniques. For real world implementations, we provide computationally feasible approximation algorithms of both problems along with proven bounds on performance. Then, we extend the model to a frame-based maximization of coverage, presenting algorithms to maximize either end-of-frame coverage or time-average coverage These algorithms include a cache-aware myopic algorithm and algorithms that utilize approximate dynamic programming techniques to select data considering expected future realizations of coverage and channels. Finally, we provide simulation results of all presented algorithms that demonstrate the benefits of considering data content in scheduling as well as show the advantages of using our novel virtual queue approach, cache-aware model, and dynamic programming algorithms."

Our analysis parameterizes the age distribution of a works references and revealed three links between the age of prior knowledge and hit papers and patents.  First, works that cite literature with a low mean age and high age variance are in a citation hotspot; these works double their likelihood of being in the top 5% or better of citations.  Second, the hotspot is nearly universal in all branches of science and technology and is increasingly predictive of a works future citation impact.  Third, a scientist or inventor is significantly more likely to write a paper in the hotspot when they coauthor vs. working alone.  Our findings are based on all 28,426,345 scientific papers in the Web of Science, 1945-2013, and all 5,382,833 U.S. patents, 1950-2010 and reveal new antecedents of high impact science and the link between prior literature and tomorrows breakthrough ideas."

In this paper, we first display some of the most important\ntheoretical models that describe spreading processes, and then discuss the\nproblem of locating both the individual and multiple influential spreaders\nrespectively. Recent approaches in these two topics are presented. For the\nidentification of privileged single spreaders, we summarize several widely used\ncentralities, such as degree, betweenness centrality, PageRank, k-shell, etc. We\ninvestigate the empirical diffusion data in a large scale online social community\nLiveJournal. With this extensive dataset, we find that various measures can\nconvey very distinct information of nodes. Of all the users in the LiveJournal\nsocial network, only a small fraction of them are involved in spreading. For the\nspreading processes in LiveJournal, while degree can locate nodes participating in\ninformation diffusion with higher probability, k-shell is more effective in finding\nnodes with a large influence. Our results should provide useful information for\ndesigning efficient spreading strategies in reality."

        "abstract": "A number of predictors have been suggested to detect the most influential spreaders of information in\nonline social media across various domains such as Twitter or Facebook. In particular, degree, PageRank,\nk-core and other centralities have been adopted to rank the spreading capability of users in information\ndissemination media. So far, validation of the proposed predictors has been done by simulating the\nspreading dynamics rather than following real information flow in social networks. Consequently, only\nmodel-dependent contradictory results have been achieved so far for the best predictor. Here, we address\nthis issue directly. We search for influential spreaders by following the real spreading dynamics in a wide\nrange of networks. We find that the widely-used degree and PageRank fail in ranking users influence. We\nfind that the best spreaders are consistently located in the k-core across dissimilar social platforms such as\nTwitter, Facebook, Livejournal and scientific publishing in the American Physical Society. Furthermore,\nwhen the complete global network structure is unavailable, we find that the sum of the nearest neighbors\ndegree is a reliable local proxy for users influence. Our analysis provides practical instructions for optimal\ndesign of strategies for viral information dissemination in relevant applications."

Each node is associated with several data types, so there are links for each data type. The objective is to maximize the coverage of all data types. This is applicable to such problems as monitoring air quality in cities and coal mines using several indicators of quality. We first define the maximization criteria, and then how to modify the model and existing algorithms to solve the problem. We demonstrate the importance of the problem and the quality of our methodology on synthetic and realistic scenarios."

Due to the limitation of current state-of-the-art Chinese word segmentation performance, a character-based name tagger can outperform its word-based counterparts for Chinese but not for Japanese; (2). It is crucial to keep segmentation settings (e.g. definitions, specifications, methods) consistent between training and testing for name tagging; (3). As long as (2) is ensured, the performance of word segmentation does not have appreciable impact on Chinese and Japanese name tagging."

Automatic extraction of the most informative and important multimedia summary (e.g. a ranked list of inter-connected texts and images) from massive amounts of cross-media and cross-genre data can significantly save users time and effort that is consumed in browsing. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address this new task based on automatically constructed Multi-media Information Networks (MiNets) by incorporating cross-genre knowledge and inferring implicit similarity across texts and images. The facts from MiNets are exploited in a novel random walk-based algorithm to iteratively propagate ranking scores across multiple data modalities. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our MiNets-based approach and the power of cross-media cross-genre inference."

Typical Information Filtering techniques are keyword-based approaches or focused on co-occurrence with keywords. However, these approaches can miss relevant local information if messages do not contain an initially considered event-related keyword. Considering geolocation, user and temporal information within a pseudo-relevance feedback approach we can find eventrelated terminology but not co-occurring with initially considered keywords. Thus, taking into account the temporal aspect we can modify a query expansion function like Kullback-Leibler divergence in order to improve the Information Filtering process. Our proposed approaches have been evaluated in two Twitter datasets associated with real-world events, obtaining encouraging results."

This way we can skip manual annotation for new event types, while requiring only minimal annotated training data for few example events at system setup.

In particular we introduce topic modeling methodologies into entity biography profiling, so as to build a bridge between fuzzy and exact matching. On one side, we employ the topics in a small-scale high-quality relevant documents (i.e., exact matching results) to summarize the life slices of a target entity (i.e., biography), and on the other side, we use the biography as a reliable reference material to detect new truly relevant documents from a large-scale partially complete pseudo-feedback (i.e., fuzzy matching results). We leverage the archiving method to enhance slot filling systems. Experiments on KBP corpus show significant improvement over state of-the-art."

Existing event extractors for social media suffer from two major problems: lack of context and informal nature. In this paper, instead of conducting event extraction solely on each social media message, we incorporate cross-genre knowledge to boost the event extractor performance. Experiment results demonstrate that without any additional annotations, our proposed approach is able to provide 15% absolute F-score improvement over the state-of-the-art."

Previous work on tweet ranking and classification mainly focused on salience and social network features or rely on web documents such as online news articles. In this paper, we exploit language independent journalism and content based features to identify news from tweets. We propose a novel newsworthiness classifier trained through active learning and investigate human assessment and automatic methods to encode it on both the tweet and trending topic levels. Our findings show that content and journalism based features proved to be effective for ranking and classifying content on Twitter."

        "abstract": "Slot filling aims to extract the values (slot fillers) of specific attributes (slots types) for a given entity (query) from a largescale corpus. Slot filling remains very challenging over the past seven years. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised approach to extract slot fillers based on the following two observations: (1) a trigger is usually a salient node relative to the query and filler nodes in the dependency graph of a context sentence; (2) a relation is likely to exist if the query and candidate filler nodes are strongly connected by a relation-specific trigger. Thus we design a graph-based algorithm to automatically identify triggers based on personalized PageRank and Affinity Propagation for a given (query, filler) pair and then label the slot type based on the identified triggers. Our approach achieves 11.6%-25% higher F-score over state-ofthe-art English slot filling methods. Our experiments also demonstrate that as long as a few trigger seeds, name tagging and dependency parsing capabilities exist, this approach can be quickly adapted to any language and new slot types. Our promising results on Chinese slot filling can serve as a new benchmark."

We incorporate symbolic (e.g., Abstract Meaning Representation) and distributional semantics to detect and represent event structures and adopt a joint typing framework to simultaneously extract event types and argument roles and discover an event schema. Experiments on general and specific domains demonstrate that this framework can construct high-quality schemas with many event and argument role types, covering a high proportion of event types and argument roles in manually defined schemas. We show that extraction performance using discovered schemas is comparable to supervised models trained from a large amount of data labeled according to predefined event types. The extraction quality of new event types is also promising."

Fake news is not a new problem and its spread in social networks is well-studied. Often an underly- ing assumption in fake news discussion is that it is written to look like real news, fooling the reader who does not check for reliability of the sources or the arguments in its content. Through a unique study of three data sets and features that capture the style and the language of articles, we show that this assumption is not true. Fake news in most cases is more similar to satire than to real news, leading us to conclude that persuasion in fake news is achieved through heuristics rather than the strength of arguments. We show overall title struc- ture and the use of proper nouns in titles are very significant in differentiating fake from real. This leads us to conclude that fake news is targeted for audiences who are not likely to read beyond titles and is aimed at creating mental associations between entities and claims."

These platforms are built to facilitate crowd engagement, but not necessarily disseminate useful news to inform the masses.

While predicting news popularity has been well studied, it has not been studied in the context of crowd manipulations. In this paper, we provide some prelim- inary results to a longer term project on crowd and platform manipulations of news and news popularity. In particular, we choose to study known features for predicting news popular- ity and how those features may change on reddit.com, a social platform used commonly for news aggregation. Along with this, we explore ways in which users can alter the per- ception of news through changing the title of an article. The results we provide are preliminary and need to be further ex- plored, but we hope this paper provides insight into news on reddit and future research directions.\n"

Can we detect it in real time, with an accuracy guarantee? \nPast studies have shown that dense subtensors tend to indicate anomalous or even fraudulent behavior in many tensor data including social media, Wikipedia, and TCP dumps. Thus, several approaches have been proposed for detecting dense subtensors rapidly and accurately. However, all these methods assume static tensors, while tensors evolve over time in many real-world applications such as social media and web.\nWe propose DenseStream, an incremental algorithm that maintains and updates dense subtensors in a tensor stream (i.e., sequences of changes in a tensor), and DenseAlert, an incremental algorithm spotting the sudden appearances of dense subtensors. \nOur methods are: (1) Fast and any-time: updates by our methods are up to a million times faster than the fastest batch algorithms, (2) Provably accurate: our methods guarantee a lower bound on the density of the subtensors they maintain, and (3) Effective: our DenseAlert successfully spots anomalies in real-world data, especially those overlooked by existing methods."

        "abstract": "How do the k-core structure of real-world graphs look like? What are the common patterns and the anomalies? How can we exploit them for applications?  A k-core is the maximal subgraph where all vertices have degree at least k. This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis, graph visualization, and graph clustering. Here, we explore pervasive patterns related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from diverse domains.\n\nOur discoveries are: (1) Mirror Pattern: coreness (i.e., maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core) is strongly correlated to degree. (2) Core-Triangle Pattern: degeneracy (i.e., maximum k such that the k-core exists) obeys a 3-to-1 power law with respect to the count of triangles. (3) Structured Core Pattern: degeneracy-cores are not cliques but have non-trivial structures such as core-periphery and communities.\n\nOur algorithmic contributions show the usefulness of these patterns. (1) Core-A, which measures the deviation from Mirror Pattern, successfully spots anomalies in real-world graphs, (2) Core-D, a single-pass streaming algorithm based on Core-Triangle Pattern, accurately estimates degeneracy up to 7_x0002_ faster than its competitor. (3) Core-S, inspired by Structured Core Pattern, identi_x000C_fies influential spreaders up to 17_x0002_ faster than its competitors with comparable accuracy."

        "abstract": "Complex networks have been shown to exhibit universal properties, with one of the most consistent patterns being the scale-free degree distribution, but are there regularities obeyed by the r-hop neighborhood in real networks? We answer this question by identifying another power-law pattern that describes the relationship between the fractions of node pairs C(r) within r hops and the hop count r. This scale-free distribution is pervasive and describes a large variety of networks, ranging from social and urban to technological and biological networks. In particular, inspired by the definition of the fractal correlation dimension D2 on a point-set, we consider the hop-count r to be the underlying distance metric between two vertices of the network, and we examine the scaling of C(r) with r. We find that this relationship follows a power-law in real networks within the range 2  r  d, where d is the effective diameter of the network, that is, the 90-th percentile distance. We term this relationship as power-hop and the corresponding power-law exponent as power-hop exponent h. We provide theoretical justification for this pattern under successful existing network models, while we analyze a large set of real and synthetic network datasets and we show the pervasiveness of the power-hop."

Our second contribution is a novel, parameter-free, and scalable fitting algorithm, EcoWeb-Fit, that estimates the parameters of EcoWeb.

        "abstract": "Given a directed graph of millions of nodes, how can we automatically spot anomalous, suspicious nodes judging only from their connectivity patterns? Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications, from Twitter users who buy fake followers, manipulating the social network, to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks, disturbing the network traffic graph. We propose a fast and effective method, CatchSync, which exploits two of the tell-tale signs left in graphs by fraudsters: (a) synchronized behavior: suspicious nodes have extremely similar behavior patterns because they are often required to perform some task together (such as follow the same user); and (b) rare behavior: their connectivity patterns are very different from the majority. We introduce novel measures to quantify both concepts (synchronicity and normality) and we propose a parameter-free algorithm that works on the resulting synchronicity-normality plots. Thanks to careful design, CatchSync has the following desirable properties: (a) it is scalable to large datasets, being linear in the graph size; (b) it is parameter free; and (c) it is side-information-oblivious: it can operate using only the topology, without needing labeled data, nor timing information, and the like., while still capable of using side information if available. We applied CatchSync on three large, real datasets, 1-billion-edge Twitter social graph, 3-billion-edge, and 12-billion-edge Tencent Weibo social graphs, and several synthetic ones; CatchSync consistently outperforms existing competitors, both in detection accuracy by 36% on Twitter and 20% on Tencent Weibo, as well as in speed."

        "abstract": "Large graphs are prevalent in many applications and enable a variety of information dissemination processes, e.g., meme, virus, and influence propagation. How can we optimize the underlying graph structure to affect the outcome of such dissemination processes in a desired way (e.g., stop a virus propagation, facilitate the propagation of a piece of good idea, etc)? Existing research suggests that the leading eigenvalue of the underlying graph is the key metric in determining the so-called epidemic threshold for a variety of dissemination models. In this paper, we study the problem of how to optimally place a set of edges (e.g., edge deletion and edge addition) to optimize the leading eigenvalue of the underlying graph, so that we can guide the dissemination process in a desired way. We propose effective, scalable algorithms for edge deletion and edge addition, respectively. In addition, we reveal the intrinsic relationship between edge deletion and node deletion problems. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms."

The paradigm is appropriate for mission-driven systems, where the goal is to enable faster, leaner, and more effective decision making. All resource consumption, in this paradigm, is tied to the needs of making decisions on alternative courses of action. A point of departure from traditional architectures lies in interfaces that allow applications to specify their underlying decision logic. This specification, in turn, allows the system to reason about most effective means to meet information needs of decisions, resulting in simultaneous optimization of decision accuracy, cost, and speed. The paper discusses the overall vision of decision-driven execution, outlining preliminary work and novel challenges.   "

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of choosing the right sources to solicit data from in sensing applications involving broadcast channels, such as those crowdsensing applications where sources share their observations on social media. The goal is to select sources such that expected fusion error is minimized. We assume that soliciting data from a source incurs a cost and that the cost budget is limited. Contrary to other formulations of this problem, we focus on the case where some sources influence others. Hence, asking a source to make a claim affects the behavior of other sources as well, according to an influence model. The paper makes two contributions. First, we develop an analytic model for estimating expected fusion error, given a particular influence graph and solution to the source selection problem. Second, we use that model to search for a solution that minimizes expected fusion error, formulating it as a zero-one integer non-linear programming (INLP) problem. To scale the approach, the paper further proposes a novel reliability-based pruning heuristic (RPH) and a similarity-based lossy estimation (SLE) algorithm that significantly reduce the complexity of the INLP algorithm at the cost of a modest approximation. The analytically computed expected fusion error is validated using both simulations and real-world data from Twitter, demonstrating a good match between analytic predictions and empirical measurements. It is also shown that our method outperforms baselines in terms of resulting fusion error. \n"

        "abstract": "This paper describes characteristics of information flow on social channels, as a function of content type and relations among individual sources, distilled from analysis of Twitter data as well as human subject survey results. The working hypothesis is that individuals who propagate content on social media act (e.g., decide whether to relay information or not) in accordance with their understanding of the content, as well as their own beliefs and trust relations. Hence, the resulting aggregate content propagation pattern encodes the collective content interpretation of the underlying group, as well as their relations. Analysis algorithms are described to recover such relations from the observed propagation patterns as well as improve our understanding of the content itself in a language agnostic manner simply from its propagation characteristics. An example is to measure the degree of community polarization around contentious topics, identify the factions involved, and recognize their individual views on issues. The analysis is independent of the language of discourse itself, making it valuable for multilingual media, where the number of languages used may render language-specific analysis less scalable. "

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present GDA, a generalized decision aggregation framework that integrates information from distributed\nsensor nodes for decision making in a resource efficient manner. Different from traditional approaches, our proposed GDA framework\nis able to not only estimate the reliability of each sensor, but also take advantage of its confidence information, and thus achieves\nhigher decision accuracy. Targeting generalized problem domains, our framework can naturally handle the scenarios where different\nsensor nodes observe different sets of events whose numbers of possible classes may also be different. GDA also makes no\nassumption about the availability level of ground truth label information, while being able to take advantage of any if present. For these\nreasons, our approach can be applied to a much broader spectrum of sensing scenarios. In this paper, we also propose two extensions\nof the GDA framework, i.e., incremental GDA (I-GDA) and parallel GDA (P-GDA) to deal with streaming and large-scale data. The\nadvantages of our proposed methods are demonstrated through both theoretic analysis and extensive experiments."

        "abstract": "A recent direction in quality-of-service-aware networked sensing literature has been to design novel communication protocols and scheduling policies for data delivery that are optimized specifically for decision needs. A hallmark of these protocols is that they are aware of the inference structure used to arrive at decisions (from logical predicates), as well as the data (and data quality) that needs to be furnished to successfully evaluate the individual predicates on which these decisions are based. Such protocols can therefore deliver precisely the right data, at the right level of quality, from the right sources, at the right time, to enable valid and timely decisions at minimum cost to the underlying network. This paper presents the used decision model and protocol design philosophy, reviews the key recent results, and outlines remaining future challenges in this emerging paradigm. Evaluation results are also presented that compare the performance of the decision-centric information delivery paradigm to several baselines, demonstrating its various advantages in terms of decision timeliness, validity, and used network resources.

        "abstract": "Networks appear naturally in many high-impact real-world applications. In an increasingly connected and coupled world, the networks arising from many application domains are often collected from different channels, forming the so-called multi-layered networks, such as cyber-physical systems, organization-level collaboration platforms, critical infrastructure networks and many more. Compared with single-layered networks, multi-layered networks are more vulnerable as even a small disturbance on one supporting layer/network might cause a ripple effect to all the dependent layers, leading to a catastrophic/cascading failure of the entire system. The state-of-the-art has been largely focusing on modeling and manipulating the cascading effect of two-layered interdependent network systems for some specific type of network connectivity measure. This paper generalizes the challenge to multiple dimensions. First, we propose a new data model for multi-layered networks MULAN, which admits an arbitrary number of layers with a much more flexible dependency structure among different layers, beyond the current pair-wise dependency. Second, we unify a wide range of classic network connectivity measures SUBLINE. Third, we show that for any connectivity measure in the SUBLINE family, it enjoys the diminishing returns property which in turn lends itself to a family of provable near-optimal control algorithms with linear complexity. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations on real network data, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

        "abstract": "Network growth can be framed as a competition for edges among nodes in the network. As with various other social and physical systems, skill (fitness) and luck (random chance) act as fundamental forces driving competition dynamics. In the context of networks, cumulative advantage (CA)the rich-get-richer effectis seen as a driving principle governing the edge accumulation process. However, competitions coupled with CA exhibit non-trivial behavior and little is formally known about duration and intensity of CA competitions. By isolating two nodes in an ideal CA competition, we provide a mathematical understanding of how CA exacerbates the role of luck in detriment of skill. We show, for instance, that when nodes start with few edges, an early stroke of luck can place the less skilled in the lead for an extremely long period of time, a phenomenon we call struggle of the fittest. We prove that duration of a simple skill and luck competition model exhibit power-law tails when CA is present, regardless of skill difference, which is in sharp contrast to the exponential tails when fitness is distinct but CA is absent. We also prove that competition intensity is always upper bounded by an exponential tail, irrespective of CA and skills. Thus, CA competitions can be extremely long (infinite mean, depending on fitness ratio) but almost never very intense. The theoretical results are corroborated by extensive numerical simulations. Our findings have important implications to competitions not only among nodes in networks but also in contexts that leverage socio-physical models embodying CA competitions."

More entity types and mention types were also added into some languages. In this paper we provide an overview of the task definition, annotation issues, successful methods and research challenges associated with this new task. This new task has attracted a lot of participants and has intrigued many interesting research problems and potential approaches.

While knowledge graphs are structure-flexible and content-rich, they are difficult to use. The challenge lies in the gap between their overwhelming complexity and the limited database knowledge of non-professional users. If writing structured queries over simple tables is difficult, complex graphs are only harder to query. As an initial step toward improving the usability of knowledge graphs, we propose to query such data by example entity tuples, without requiring users to form complex graph queries. Our system, Graph Query By Example (GQBE), automatically discovers a weighted hidden maximum query graph based on input query tuples, to capture a users query intent. It then efficiently finds and ranks the top approximate matching answer graphs and answer tuples. We conducted experiments and user studies on the large Freebase and DBpedia datasets and observed appealing accuracy and efficiency. Our system provides a complementary approach to the existing keyword-based methods, facilitating user-friendly graph querying. To the best of our knowledge, there was no such proposal in the past in the context of graphs."

In manyapplications, however, there exist multiple related networks, inwhich each network may be constructed from a different domainand instances in one domain may be related to instances in otherdomains. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm, MCA, formulti-network clustering that takes into account cross-domain relationshipsbetween instances. MCA has several advantages overthe existing single network clustering methods. First, it is ableto detect associations between clusters from different domains, which, however, is not addressed by any existing methods. Second, it achieves more consistent clustering results on multiple networksby leveraging the duality between clustering individual networksand inferring cross-network cluster alignment. Finally, it providesa multi-network clustering solution that is more robust to noiseand errors. We perform extensive experiments on a variety ofreal and synthetic networks to demonstrate the effectiveness andefficiency of MCA."

In this article, we examine whether religious disaffiliation structures social network formation in a social context in which religious identification (and religiosity) is a salient cultural marker. We take advantage of unique data on the personal networks of youth transitioning into a college where religion is a culturally salient facet of everyday life. We hypothesize that, if there is nonreligious homophily, it may result from an attraction of the disaffiliated to each other or from a repulsion away from the religiously affiliated. Results of exponential random graph models suggest that both mechanisms may be at play. We find that religious Nones and affiliated non-Catholics are disproportionately more likely to form and maintain relationships with one another and are relatively less likely to form and maintain relationships with members of their respective religious out-groups. We close by outlining the implications of our findings and delineating promising avenues for future research."

We also observe that some videos suddenly go viral through peoples sharing in online social networks (OSNs). Do these seemingly different phenomena share a common structure?All these phenomena are associated with sudden surges of user activities in networks, which we call bursts in this work. We uncover that the emergence of a burst is accompanied with the formation of triangles in networks. This finding motivates us to propose a new and robust method to detect bursts in OSNs. We first introduce a new measure, triadic cardinality distribution, corresponding to the fractions of nodes with different numbers of triangles, i.e., triadic cardinalities, within a network. We demonstrate that this distribution not only changes when a burst occurs, but it also has a robustness property that it is immunized against common spamming social-bot attacks. Hence, by tracking triadic cardinality distributions, we can reliably detect bursts in OSNs. To avoid handling massive activity data generated by OSN users during the triadic tracking, we design an efficient sample-estimate solution to provide maximum likelihood estimate on the triadic cardinality distribution from sampled data. Extensive experiments conducted on real data demonstrate the usefulness of this triadic cardinality distribution and effectiveness of our sample-estimate solution."

Despite recent efforts on computing the number of instances a specific graphlet appears in a large graph (i.e., the total number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet), little attention has been paid to characterizing a nodes graphlet degree, i.e., the number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet that include the node, which is an important metric for analyzing complex networks such as social and biological networks. Similar to global graphlet counting, it is challenging to compute node graphlet degrees for a large graph due to the combinatorial nature of the problem. Unfortunately, previous methods of computing global graphlet counts are not suited to solve this problem. In this paper we propose sampling methods to estimate node graphlet degrees for undirected and directed graphs, and analyze the error of our estimates. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study this problem and give a fast scalable solution. We conduct experiments on a variety of real-word datasets that demonstrate that our methods accurately and efficiently estimate node graphlet degrees for graphs with millions of edges."

To extract value from these large, multi-domain pools of text, it is of great importance to gain an understanding of entities and their relationships. In this tutorial, we introduce data-driven methods to recognize typed entities of interest in massive, domain-specific text corpora. These methods can automatically identify token spans as entity mentions in documents and label their fine-grained types (e.g., people, product and food) in a scalable way. Since these methods do not rely on annotated data, predefined typing schema or hand-crafted features, they can be quickly adapted to a new domain, genre and language. We demonstrate on real datasets including various genres (e.g., news articles, discussion forum posts, and tweets), domains (general vs. bio-medical domains) and languages (e.g., English, Chinese, Arabic, and even low-resource languages like Hausa and Yoruba) how these typed entities aid in knowledge discovery and management"

        "abstract": "Backpressure routing, in which packets are preferentially transmitted over links with high queue differentials, offers the promise of throughput-optimal operation for a wide range of communication networks. However, when traffic load is low, backpressure methods suffer from long delays. This is of particular concern in intermittent encounter-based mobile networks which are already delay-limited due to the sparse and highly dynamic network connectivity. While state of the art mechanisms for such networks have proposed the use of redundant transmissions to improve delay, they do not work well when traffic load is high. In this paper we propose backpressure with adaptive redundancy (BWAR), a novel hybrid approach that provides the best of both worlds. This approach is robust, distributed, and does not require any prior knowledge of network load conditions. We also present variants of BWAR that remove redundant packets via a timeout mechanism, and that improve energy use. These algorithms are evaluated by mathematical analysis and by simulations of real traces of taxis in Beijing, China. The simulations confirm that BWAR outperforms traditional backpressure at low load, while outperforming encounter-routing schemes (Spray and Wait and Spray and Focus) at high load."

        "abstract": "How can we tell if Alice is a talkative person or a silent person? In this paper, we focus on the node classification problem on networked data such as social networks and the web. There are two open challenges with this problem: (1) we want to handle various kinds of label correlations in real-world networks such as homophily (i.e., love of the same) and heterophily (i.e., love of the different), and (2) we want to exploit the confidence of the inference results to enhance the accuracy. There is no algorithm that solves these two challenges at the same time. We tackle with these two challenges by proposing CAMLP, a novel node classification algorithm. Our contributions are three-fold: (a) Novel algorithm; our algorithm is confidence-aware and is applicable to both homophily and heterophily networks, (b) Theory; we give theoretical analyses of our algorithm, and (c) Practice; we perform extensive experiments on 5 different network datasets including homophily and heterophily networks. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm improves the precision of major competitors not only on heterophily networks, but also on homophily networks."

In this setting, datasets commonly have well-defined sets of dimensions and measures around which analysis tasks can be conducted. However, many forms of data used in intelligence operations  deriving from social networks, online communications, and text corpora  will consist of graphs with varying forms of potential dimensional structure. Hence, enabling OLAP over such data collections requires explicit definition and extraction of supporting dimensions and measures. Further, as Graph OLAP remains an emerging technique, limited research has been done on its user interface requirements. Namely, on effective pairing of interface designs to different types of graph-derived dimensions and measures."

The cognitive model is based on the memory retrieval processes of the ACT-R cognitive architecture, most specifically its underpinnings in the rational analysis of cognition. The model is shown to capture well the temporal and spatial characteristics of the data. Finally, we discuss potential issues in the application of cognitive models as decision aids and recommender systems, in particular the ability to introspect in the workings of the model to select data most suitable for the human decision making process."

Small communities, however, account for a higher proportion of a social networks community membership and reveal important information about the members of these communities.

        "abstract": "In many applications, one can obtain descriptions about the same objects or events from a variety of sources. As a result, this will inevitably lead to data or information conflicts. One important problem is to identify the true information (i.e., the truths) among conflicting sources of data. It is intuitive to trust reliable sources more when deriving the truths, but it is usually unknown which one is more reliable a priori. Moreover, each source possesses a variety of properties with different data types. An accurate estimation of source reliability has to be made by modeling multiple properties in a unified model. Existing conflict resolution work either does not conduct source reliability estimation, or models multiple properties separately. In this paper, we propose to resolve conflicts among multiple sources of heterogeneous data types. We model the problem using an optimization framework where truths and source reliability are defined as two sets of unknown variables. The objective is to minimize the overall weighted deviation between the truths and the multi-source observations where each source is weighted by its reliability. Different loss functions can be incorporated into this framework to recognize the characteristics of various data types, and efficient computation approaches are developed. The proposed framework is further adapted to deal with streaming data in an incremental fashion and large-scale data in MapReduce model. Experiments on real-world weather, stock, and flight data as well as simulated multi-source data demonstrate the advantage of jointly modeling different data types in the proposed framework."

While recently there has been much progress in understanding the general properties of multilayer networks, our understanding of how to control such systems remains limited. One fundamental aspect that makes this endeavor challenging is that each layer can operate at a different time scale; thus, we cannot directly apply standard ideas from structural control theory of individual networks. Here we address the problem of controlling multilayer and multi-time-scale networks focusing on two-layer multiplex networks with one-to-one interlayer coupling. We investigate the practically relevant case when the control signal is applied to the nodes of one layer. We develop a theory based on disjoint path covers to determine the minimum number of inputs "

Graph similarity with given node correspondence, i.e., the detection of changes in the connectivity of graphs, arises in numerous settings. In this work, we formally state the axioms and desired properties of the graph similarity functions, and evaluate when state-of-the-art methods fail to detect crucial connectivity changes in graphs. We propose DeltaCon, a principled, intuitive, and scalable algorithm that assesses the similarity between two graphs on the same nodes (e.g., employees of a company, customers of a mobile carrier). In conjunction, we propose DeltaCon-Attr, a related approach that enables attribution of change or dissimilarity to responsible nodes and edges. Experiments on various synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over existing similarity measures. Finally, we employ DeltaCon and DeltaCon-Attr on real applications: (a) we classify people to groups of high and low creativity based on their brain connectivity graphs, (b) do temporal anomaly detection in the who-emails-whom Enron graph and find the top culprits for the changes in the temporal corporate email graph, and (c) recover pairs of test-retest large brain scans ( 17M edges, up to 90M edges) for 21 subjects."

Given a graph-structured network G(N, A), where N is a set of vertices and A  N N is a set of edges, in which a subset Al  A of edges are properly labeled a priori, determine for those edges in Au = AAl the edge labels which are unknown. The edge classification problem has numerous applications in graph mining and social network analysis, such as relationship discovery, categorization, and recommendation. Although the vertex classification problem has been well known and extensively explored in networks, edge classification is relatively unknown and in an urgent need for careful studies. In this paper, we present a series of efficient, neighborhood-based algorithms to perform edge classification in networks. To make the proposed algorithms scalable in large-scale networks, which can be either disk-resident or streamlike, we further devise efficient, cost-effective probabilistic edge classification methods without a significant compromise to the classification accuracy. We carry out experimental studies in a series of real-world networks, and the experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods for edge classification in large networks."

Traditional truth discovery task aims to identify the truth the most trustworthy information, from conicting sources in dierent scenarios. In this kind of tasks, truth is regarded as a xed value or a set of xed values. However, in a number of real-world cases, objective truth existence cannot be ensured and we can only identify single or multiple reliable facts from opinions. Dierent from traditional truth discovery task, we address this uncertainty and introduce the concept of trustworthy opinion of an entity, treat it as a random variable, and use its distribution to describe consistency or controversy, which is particularly dicult for data which can be numerically measured, i.e. quantitative information. In this study, we focus on the quantitative opinion, propose an uncertainty-aware approach called Kernel Density Estimation from Multiple Sources (KDEm) to estimate its probability distribution, and summarize trustworthy in-formation based on this distribution. Experiments indicate that KDEm not only has outstanding performance on the classical numeric truth discovery task, but also shows good performance on multi-modality detection and anomaly detection in the uncertain-opinion setting."

        "abstract": "Forecasting the success of scientific work has been attracting extensive research attention in the recent years. It is often of key importance to foresee the pathway to impact for scholarly entities for (1) tracking research frontier, (2) invoking an early intervention and (3) proactively allocating research resources. Many recent progresses have been seen in modeling the long-term scientific impact for point prediction. However, challenges still remain when it comes to forecasting the impact pathway. In this paper, we propose a novel predictive model to collectively achieve a set of design objectives to address these challenges, including prediction consistency and parameter smoothness. Extensive empirical evaluations on real scholarly data validate the effectiveness of the proposed model."

To effectively leverage such heterogeneity, in this article, we propose a novel graph-based model for Learning with both Label and Feature heterogeneity, namely L2F. It models the label correlation by requiring that any two label-specific classifiers behave similarly on the same views if the associated labels are similar, and imposes the view consistency by requiring that view-based classifiers generate similar predictions on the same examples. The objective function for L2F is jointly convex. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. One appealing feature of L2F is that it is capable of handling data with missing views and labels. Furthermore, we analyze its generalization performance based on Rademacher complexity, which sheds light on the benefits of jointly modeling the label and feature heterogeneity. Experimental results on various biomedical datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Wikipedia, one such collectively built information source, is often our first stop for information on all kinds of topics; its quality has stood up to many tests, and it prides itself on having a neutral point of view. Enforcement of neutrality is in the hands of comparatively few, powerful administrators. In this article, we document that a surprisingly large number of editors change their behavior and begin focusing more on a particular controversial topic once they are promoted to administrator status. The conscious and unconscious biases of these few, but powerful, administrators may be shaping the information on many of the most sensitive topics on Wikipedia; some may even be explicitly infiltrating the ranks of administrators in order to promote their own points of view. In addition, we ask whether administrators who change their behavior in this suspicious manner can be identified in advance. Neither prior history nor vote counts during an administrators election are useful in doing so, but we find that an alternative measure, which gives more weight to influential voters, can successfully reject these suspicious candidates. This second result has important implications for how we harness collective intelligence: even if wisdom exists in a collective opinion (like a vote), that signal can be lost unless we carefully distinguish the true expert voter from the noisy or manipulative voter."

A related, harder problem is: how can we assign a numerical score to each lesson plan (i.e., way of conveying information)? Here, we give a formal definition of this problem of forming learning units and we provide a metric for comparing different approaches based on information theory. We also design an algorithm, groupNteach, for this problem.

Previous work made the strong assumption that the graph topology of interest is known in advance. In practice, sometimes researchers have to deal with the situation where the graph topology is unknown because it is expensive to collect and store all topological and meta information. Hence, typically what is available to researchers is only a snapshot of the graph, i.e., a subgraph of the graph. Crawling methods such as breadth first sampling can be used to generate the snapshot. However, these methods fail to sample a streaming graph represented as a high speed stream of edges. Therefore, graph mining applications such as network traffic monitoring use random edge sampling (i.e., sample each edge with a fixed probability) to collect edges and generate a sampled graph, which we called a RESampled graph. Clearly, a RESampled graphs motif statistics may be quite different from those of the underlying original graph. To resolve this, we propose a framework and implement a system called Minfer, which takes the given RESampled graph and accurately infers the underlying graphs motif statistics. We also apply Fisher information to bound the errors of our estimates. Experiments using large scale datasets show the accuracy and efficiency of our method."

This allows us to capture a wide array of MAC-layer approaches and their costs, simply by varying the value of b (relative to A), in a problem formulation subsuming the Connected Dominating Set and Spanning Tree problems. We give a systematic analysis of this problem, including positive and negative results. In particular, we show the problem is: approximable by a factor varying from 2H + 2 down to 2 as b varies from 0 to 1 (where is the maximum degree of the network graph and H is the th harmonic number); and thence approximable by a factor varying from 2 to 1 (i.e., optimal) as b varies from 1 to log2( 1 A + 2); and optimally solvable thereafter. Finally, we present numerical results comparing the two algorithms above with other natural heuristics. We find there is an advantage in algorithms taking into consideration the value b, even if b can only be roughly estimated."

An important part of this analysis is to determine the key patterns of flow in the underlying network. Almost all the work in this area has focused on fixed models of the network structure, and edge-based transmission between nodes. In this article, we propose a fully content-centered model of flow analysis in networks, in which the analysis is based on actual content transmissions in the underlying social stream, rather than a static model of transmission on the edges. First, we introduce the problem of influence analysis in the context of information flow in networks. We then propose a novel algorithm InFlowMine to discover the information flow patterns in the network and demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovered information flows using an influence mining application. This application illustrates the flexibility and effectiveness of our information flow model to find topic- or network-specific influencers, or their combinations. We empirically show that our information flow mining approach is effective and efficient than the existing methods on a number of different measures."

In the proposed Multidimensional Customer-Product Network (MCPN), customer-product interactions are viewed as a socio-technical system where separate entities of  customers  and  products  are simultaneously modeled as two layers of a network, and multiple types of relations, such as consideration and purchase, product associations, and customer social interactions, are considered. We first introduce a unidimensional network where aggregated customer preferences and product similarities are analyzed to inform designers about the implied product competitions and market segments. We then extend the network to a multidimensional structure where customer social interactions are introduced for evaluating social influence on heterogeneous product preferences. Beyond the traditional descriptive analysis used in network analysis, we employ the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) as a unified statistical inference framework to interpret complex preference decisions. Our approach broadens the traditional utility-based logit models by considering dependency among complex customer-product relations, including the similarity of associated products,  irrationality  of customers induced by social influence, nested multi-choice decisions, and correlated attributes of customers and products."

Often these processes are intertwined, and in order to study them, statistical models must be developed that account for coevolution of multiple network components. The increased availability of continuous time network data has prompted new models for network inference such as the relational event framework. While network data may be continuously observable, the characteristics or state of an individual can still only be observed periodically. This type of panel data can be readily analyzed using actor-oriented models, but these methods do not accommodate continuous network data. We propose a model that integrates the relational event framework with actor-oriented models for behavioral change, allowing us to model the joint dynamics of relational events and individual states. This composite model preserves the advantages of each method, while leveraging the richer information available in relational event data. We apply our model to datasets collected from virtual team experiments to highlight the utility of our method."

Results of a user study (N=240) are discussed, with four conditions being evaluated with varying degrees of visualization, interaction and control.

The vast majority of existing algorithms focus on unsigned social networks (or social networks with only positive links), while little work exists for signed social networks. It is evident from recent developments in signed social network analysis that negative links have added value over positive links. Therefore, the incorporation of negative links has the potential to benefit various analytical tasks. In this paper, we study the novel problem of node classification in signed social networks. We provide a principled way to mathematically model positive and negative links simultaneously and propose a novel framework NCSSN for node classification in signed social networks.

Here, we study the problem of subgraph density in signed networks and show connections to the event detection task. Notions of density have been used in prior studies on anomaly detection, but all existing methods have been developed for unsigned networks. We develop the first algorithms for finding dense subgraphs in signed networks using semi-definite programming based rounding. We give rigorous guarantees for our algorithms, and develop a heuristic EGOSCAN which is significantly faster. We evaluate the performance of EGOSCAN for different notions of density, and observe that it performs significantly better than natural adaptations of prior algorithms for unsigned networks. In particular, the improvement in edge density over previous methods is as much as 85% and usually over 50%. These results are consistent across signed and unsigned networks in different domains. The improvement in performance is even more significant for a constrained version of the problem involving finding subgraphs containing a subset of query nodes. We also develop an event detection method for signed and unsigned networks based on subgraph density. We apply this to three different temporal datasets, and show that our method based on EGOSCAN significantly outperforms existing approaches and baseline methods in terms of the precision-recall tradeoff (by as much as 25-50% in some instances)."

        "abstract": "Eigen-functions are of key importance in graph mining since they can be used to approximate many graph parameters, such as node centrality, epidemic threshold, graph robustness, with high accuracy. As real-world graphs are changing over time, those parameters may get sharp changes correspondingly. Taking virus propagation network for example, new connections between infected and susceptible people appear all the time, and some of the crucial infections may lead to large decreasing on the epidemic threshold of the network. As a consequence, the virus would spread around the network quickly. However, if we can keep track of the epidemic threshold as the graph structure changes, those crucial infections would be identified timely so that counter measures can be taken proactively to contain the spread process. In our paper, we propose two online eigen-functions tracking algorithms which can effectively monitor those key parameters with linear complexity. Furthermore, we propose a general attribution analysis framework which can be used to identify important structural changes in the evolving process. In addition, we introduce an error estimation method for the proposed eigen-functions tracking algorithms to estimate the tracking error at each time stamp. Finally, extensive evaluations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms."

Despite this interest in understanding the process underlying the unfolding of relationships in teams, current theoretical and operational formulations of team process require greater specificity if they are to truly afford a high-resolution understanding. Most researchers interested in team process, study it as either a snapshot, or as a limited series of snapshots, rather than as a continuous movie displaying the nuanced sequential interactions unfolding among varying subsets of team members. Given the increasing availability of rich data regarding team dynamics, corresponding advances are needed in conceptual and analytic frameworks to utilize continuous-time data to further our understanding of team processes. This paper identifies four challenges that hinder the identification of team process/dynamics and elaborates a theoretical approach with the associated analytic machinery needed to advance a truly time-sensitive understanding of team process."

        "abstract": "Deployed United States Army Soldiers operate in dynamic situations, yet there is little known about how to most effectively train Soldier combat skills in a stress-inducing environment prior to deployment. In order to best simulate the experiences of Soldiers in theater, a training environment must be immersive, creating the illusion of being there, thus providing a heightened level of arousal and encouraging the desire to perform well within the training. A 300-degree immersive simulator was used to examine the potential effectiveness of such a training environment. Participants performed a Shoot-Dont-Shoot task with two types of performance feedback, shock and lifebar loss Levels of arousal were continuously measured through heart rate variability (HRV); psychophysiological measures have been linked to psychological stress and cognitive function. HRV was measured through interbeat interval (IBI), or the peak-to-peak interval of heartbeats, which is linked to cognitive arousal. Higher levels of arousal were seen in the Shock condition compared to the Life Bar condition. IBI was additionally examined in a Baseline session as well as Post-Shock and Post-Life Bar sessions, and results showed that IBI returned to near Baseline levels after both conditions, indicating a recovery from arousal induced during the scenarios. These results show the value of objectively measuring physiology to assess heightened arousal during Soldier-relevant tasks in a simulated environment. Examining the extent to which Soldiers experience arousal, which can often be a proxy for stress, can indicate how immersive or stressful an environment is, and therefore its potential effectiveness as a realistic pre-deployment training environment."

        "abstract": "We study the problem of synopsis construction of massive graph streams arriving in real-time. Many graphs such as those formed by the activity on social networks, communication networks, and telephone networks are defined dynamically as rapid edge streams on a massive domain of nodes. In these rapid and massive graph streams, it is often not possible to estimate the frequency of individual items (e.g., edges, nodes) with complete accuracy. Nevertheless, sketch-based stream summaries such as Count-Min can preserve frequency information of high-frequency items with a reasonable accuracy. However, these sketch summaries lose the underlying graph structure unless one keeps information about start and end nodes of all edges, which is prohibitively expensive. For example, the existing methods can identify the high-frequency nodes and edges, but they are unable to answer more complex structural queries such as reachability defined by high-frequency edges. To this end, we design a 3-dimensional sketch, gMatrix that summarizes massive graph streams in real-time, while also retaining information about the structural behavior of the underlying graph dataset. We demonstrate how gMatrix, coupled with a onetime reverse hash mapping, is able to estimate important structural properties, e.g., reachability over high frequency edges in an online manner and with theoretical performance guarantees. Our experimental results using large-scale graph streams attest that gMatrix is capable of answering both frequency-based and structural queries with high accuracy and efficiency."

Most of the existing influence analysis methods determine the influencers in a static network with an influence propagation model based on pre-defined edge propagation probabilities. However, none of these models can be queried to find influencers in both context and time-sensitive fashion from a streaming social data. In this paper, we propose an approach to maintain real-time influence scores of users in a social stream using a topic and time-sensitive approach, while the network and topic is constantly evolving over time. We show that our approach is efficient in terms of online maintenance and effective in terms various types of real-time context- and time-sensitive queries.

Countries face both an increasing frequency and an increasing intensity of natural disasters resulting from climate change. During such events, citizens turn to social media platforms for disaster-related communication and information. Social media improves situational awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency information, enables early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief efforts. In addition, the spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages helps with the real-time monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. We present a multiscale analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We examine the online response of 50 metropolitan areas of the United States and find a strong relationship between proximity to Sandys path and hurricane-related social media activity. We show that real and perceived threats, together with physical disaster effects, are directly observable through the intensity and composition of Twitters message stream. We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter activity strongly correlates with the per-capita economic damage inflicted by the hurricane. We verify our findings for a wide range of disasters and suggest that massive online social networks can be used for rapid assessment of damage caused by a large-scale disaster."

The popularity of pervasively available social activities for social media users has encouraged a large body of literature on exploiting social networks for recommendation. The vast majority of these systems focus on unsigned social networks (or social networks with only positive links), while little work exists for signed social networks (or social networks with positive and negative links). The availability of negative links in signed social networks presents both challenges and opportunities in the recommendation process. We provide a principled and mathematical approach to exploit signed social networks for recommendation, and propose a model, RecSSN, to leverage positive and negative links in signed social networks. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We also perform further experiments to explicitly understand the effect of signed networks in RecSSN."

One important aspect affecting both areas is the critical role space plays. Indeed, growing evidence suggests both our movements and communication patterns are associated with spatial costs that follow reproducible scaling laws, each characterized by its specific critical exponents. Although human mobility and social networks develop concomitantly as two prolific yet largely separated fields, we lack any known relationships between the critical exponents explored by them, despite the fact that they often study the same datasets. Here, by exploiting three different mobile phone datasets that capture simultaneously these two aspects, we discovered a new scaling relationship, mediated by a universal flux distribution, which links the critical exponents characterizing the spatial dependencies in human mobility and social networks. Therefore, the widely studied scaling laws uncovered in these two areas are not independent but connected through a deeper underlying reality."

In addition to services based on users current location, many potential services rely on users location history, or their spatial-temporal provenance. Malicious users may lie about their spatial-temporal provenance without a carefully designed security system for users to prove their past locations. In this paper, we present the Spatial-Temporal provenance Assurance with Mutual Proofs (STAMP) scheme. STAMP is designed for ad-hoc mobile users generating location proofs for each other in a distributed setting. However, it can easily accommodate trusted mobile users and wireless access points. STAMP ensures the integrity and non-transferability of the location proofs and protects users privacy. A semi-trusted Certification Authority is used to distribute cryptographic keys as well as guard users against collusion by a light-weight entropy-based trust evaluation approach. Our prototype implementation on the Android platform shows that STAMP is low-cost in terms of computational and storage resources. Extensive simulation experiments show that our entropy-based trust model is able to achieve high ( > 0.9) collusion detection accuracy."

One major difficulty in setting up and getting participation in large-scale cognitive decathlon and grand challenge competitions, or even smaller scale cross-framework evaluation and Turing testing, is that there is no standard interface protocol that enables and facilitates human and computational agent plug-and-play participation across various tasks. We identify three major issues. First, human-readable task interfaces arent often translated into machine-readable form. Second, in the cases where a task interface is made available in a machine-readable protocol, the protocol is often task-specific, and differs from other task protocols. Finally, where both human and machine-readable versions of the task interface exist, the two versions often differ in content. This makes the bar of entry extremely high for comparison of humans and multiple computational frameworks across multiple tasks. This paper proposes a standard approach to task design where all task interactions adhere to a standard API. We provide examples of how this method can be employed to gather human and computational simulation data in text-and-button tasks, visual and animated tasks, and in real-time robotics tasks."

The data suggest pre- and postrelease social influencesoperate differently. Prerelease social influence displays a critical transition point with relation toadoption: before a critical value, any level of social influence is negligibly related to adoption, butafter the critical value, the relationship between social influence and adoption is large and substantive.In contrast, postrelease social influence exhibits a positive linear relationship with adoption.Prerelease social influence is argued to require more exposures than postrelease social influencebecause of differences in the diagnosticity and accessibility of the information. To complementthe survey data, computational models are used to test alternative hypotheses. Evidence from thecomputational models supports the proposed model of social influence."

The growth of online methods of research has resulted in effective means for social psychologists to collect large-scale survey-based data in a cost-effective and timely manner. However, the same advancement has not occurred for social psychologists who rely on experimentation as their primary method of data collection. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of one online laboratory for conducting experiments, Volunteer Science, and report the results of six studies that test canonical behaviors commonly captured in social psychological experiments. Our results show that the online laboratory is capable of performing a variety of studies with large numbers of diverse volunteers. We advocate for the use of the online laboratory as a valid and cost-effective way to perform social psychological experiments with large numbers of diverse subjects."

The literature has many methods that try to find dense blocks in matrices, and, recently, tensors, but no method gives a principled way to score the suspiciouness of dense blocks with different numbers of modes and rank them to draw human attention accordingly. Dense blocks are worth inspecting, typically indicating fraud, emerging trends, or some other noteworthy deviation from the usual. Our main contribution is that we show how to unify these methods and how to give a principled answer to questions like the above. Specifically, (a) we give a list of axioms that any metric of suspicousness should satisfy, (b) we propose an intuitive, principled metric that satisfies the axioms, and is fast to compute, (c) we propose CROSSSPOT, an algorithm to spot dense regions, and sort them in importance (suspiciousness) order. Finally, we apply CROSSSPOT to real data, where it improves the F1 score over previous techniques by 68% and finds retweet-boosting in a real social dataset spanning 0.3 billion posts."

        "abstract": "Why are some people more creative than others? How do human brain networks evolve over time? A key stepping stone to both mysteries and many more is to compare weighted brain networks. In contrast to networks arising from other application domains, the brain network exhibits its own characteristics (e.g., high density, indistinguishability), which makes any off-the-shelf data mining algorithm as well as visualization tool sub-optimal or even mis-leading. In this paper, we propose a shift from the current mining-then-visualization paradigm, to jointly model these two core building blocks (i.e., mining and visualization) for brain network comparisons. The key idea is to integrate the human perception constraint into the mining block earlier so as to guide the analysis process. We formulate this as a multi-objective feature selection problem, and propose an integrated framework, BrainQuest, to solve it. We perform extensive empirical evaluations, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."

Even worse, administrators are required to adhere to organizational policies, which frequently contain conflicting goals. While prior work in security has sought to alleviate these concerns, much of it strives to identify attacks and intrusions with approaches that require complete knowledge for analysis. In this paper, we present a framework to addresses the challenges facing administrators by using formal argumentation to generate big-picture conclusions regarding the system. Unlike other schemes, argumentation excels in situations where information is incomplete and knowledge is contradictory. To motivate our approach, we detail a scenario inspired by real-world data taken from the U.C. Davis environment."

Broadly speaking, the property of robustness is crucial in real graphs, since it is related to the structural behavior of graphs to retain their connectivity properties after losing a portion of their edges/nodes. Can we estimate a robustness index for a graph quickly? Additionally, if the graph evolves over time, how this property changes? In this work, we are trying to answer the above questions studying the expansion properties of large social graphs. First, we present a measure that characterizes the robustness properties of a graph and also serves as global measure of the community structure (or lack thereof). We show how to compute this measure efficiently by exploiting the special spectral properties of real-world networks. We apply our method on several diverse real networks with millions of nodes, and we observe interesting properties for both static and time-evolving social graphs. As an application example, we show how to spot outliers and anomalies in graphs over time. Finally, we examine how graph generating models that mimic several properties of real-world graphs and behave in terms of robustness dynamics."

        "abstract": "Geo-social networks or Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs for short) provide an abundant source of information for human behavior in real-space. The digital trails that LBSN users leave on these systems, mainly through the action of check-in (i.e., voluntary sharing of their whereabouts), span multiple dimensions such as, social (who is friend with whom?), geographical (where do people go?), temporal (when do people transit in the city), as well as contextual (what do people do in the city?) forming a composite network. It thus becomes crucial to be able to analyze the above information in a holistic way, that is, without focusing on a specific dimension only. For that, we develop GeoTense, which models a geo-social composite network as a tensor. The latter enables us to utilize an arsenal of linear algebra tools for analyzing the underlying information and identifying existing patterns. More specifically, in this work we propose the use of tensor decomposition for spotting general patterns and anomalies in the check-in behavior of users, by jointly analyzing and breaking down the behavior of all users of the LBSN into simple, interpretable latent patterns. Our evaluations showcase the potentials of GeoTense in spotting interesting patterns in geo-social networks. "

Existing approaches address this problem by sampling the exponential space of all possible subnetworks to find ones of high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we develop a novel framework that avoids sampling by formulating the problem of predictive subnetwork learning as node selection, subject to network-constrained regularization. Our framework involves two steps: (i) subspace learning, and (ii) predictive substructures discovery with network regularization. The framework is developed based upon two mathematically sound techniques of spectral graph learning and gradient descent optimization, and we show that their solutions converge to a global optimum solution - a desired property that cannot be guaranteed by sampling approaches. Through experimental analysis on a number of real world datasets, we demonstrate the performance of our framework against state-of-the-art algorithms, not only based on prediction accuracy but also in terms of domain relevance of the discovered substructures."

In contrast, research on status inferences predicts that LSM will negatively impact third-party evaluations because LSM implies followership. We conduct two studies to test these competing hypotheses. Study 1 analyzed transcripts of U.S. presidential debates between 1976 and 2012 and found that candidates who matched their opponents linguistic style increased their standing in the polls. Study 2 demonstrated a causal relationship between LSM and third-party observer evaluations using negotiation transcripts."

The same model accounts for human data in both games. The model explains transfer effects with the aid of a trust mechanism that determines how rewards change depending on the dynamics of the interaction between players. We conclude that factors pertaining to the game or the individual are insufficient to explain the whole range of transfer effects and factors pertaining to the interaction between players should be considered as well."

The precursor is a nonlinear relationbetween the fraction of individuals holding a certain extreme view and the fraction ofindividuals that includes also moderates, e.g., those who are very conservative inpolitics versus moderate to very conservative. The onset of nonlinearity forecaststhe transition from moderate to extreme opinion before it actually occurs. It isan early-warning signal of an abrupt bootstrap-percolation transition where extremeopinions cascade through society due to peoples stubbornness, as suggested bymodeling. By means of a phase diagram we classify societies from moderate to extremein terms of critical fractions of extremists and peoples ties. The nonlinear analysiscan be extended to study investors sentiment or competition of innovations of anykind, allowing to forecast sudden market events or adoption of new products."

        "abstract": "Probabilistic conditional preference networks (PCP-nets) are a gen- eralization of CP-nets for compactly representing preferences over multi-attribute domains. We introduce the notion of a loss function whose inputs are a CP-net and an outcome. We focus on the optimal decision-making problem for acyclic and cyclic CP-nets and PCP-nets. Our motivations are three-fold: (1) our framework naturally extends to allow reasoning on cyclic CP-nets and PCP- nets for full generality, (2) in the multi-agent setting, we place no restriction on agents preferences structure and voting rules under our framework have desirable axiomatic properties, (3) we generalize several previous approaches to finding the optimum outcome in individual and multi-agent contexts. We characterize the computational complexity of computing the loss of a given outcome and computing the outcomes with minimum loss for three natural loss functions: 0-1 loss, neighborhood loss, and global loss. While the optimal decision is NP-hard to compute for many cases, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the optimal decision for tree-structured PCP-nets and profiles of CP-net preferences with a shared dependency structure, w.r.t. neighborhood loss function."

        "abstract": "One of the key obstacles in making learning protocols realistic in applications is the need to supervise them, a costly process that often requires hiring domain experts. We consider the framework to use the world knowledge as indirect supervision. World knowledge is general-purpose knowledge, which is not designed for any specific domain. Then, the key challenges are how to adapt the world knowledge to domains and how to represent it for learning. In this article, we provide an example of using world knowledge for domain-dependent document clustering. We provide three ways to specify the world knowledge to domains by resolving the ambiguity of the entities and their types, and represent the data with world knowledge as a heterogeneous information network. Then, we propose a clustering algorithm that can cluster multiple types and incorporate the sub-type information as constraints. In the experiments, we use two existing knowledge bases as our sources of world knowledge. One is Freebase, which is collaboratively collected knowledge about entities and their organizations. The other is YAGO2, a knowledge base automatically extracted from Wikipedia and maps knowledge to the linguistic knowledge base, WordNet. Experimental results on two text benchmark datasets (20newsgroups and RCV1) show that incorporating world knowledge as indirect supervision can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms as well as clustering algorithms enhanced with world knowledge features.A preliminary version of this work appeared in the proceedings of KDD 2015 [Wang et al. 2015a]. This journal version has made several major improvements. First, we have proposed a new and general learning framework for machine learning with world knowledge as indirect supervision, where document clustering is a special case in the original paper. Second, in order to make our unsupervised semantic parsing method more understandable, we add several real cases from the original sentences to the resulting logic forms with all the necessary information. Third, we add details of the three semantic filtering methods and conduct deep analysis of the three semantic filters, by using case studies to show why the conceptualization-based semantic filter can produce more accurate indirect supervision. Finally, in addition to the experiment on 20 newsgroup data and Freebase, we have extended the experiments on clustering results by using all the combinations of text (20 newsgroup, MCAT, CCAT, ECAT) and world knowledge sources (Freebase, YAGO2)."

        "abstract": "Emotions are increasingly inferred linguistically from online data with a goal of predicting off-line behavior. Yet, it is unknown whether emotions inferred linguistically from online communications correlate with actual changes in off-line activity. We analyzed all 886,000 trading decisions and 1,234,822 instant messages of 30 professional day traders over a continuous 2 year period. Linguistically inferring the traders emotional states from instant messages, we find that emotions expressed in online communications reflect the same distributions of emotions found in controlled experiments done on traders. Further, we find that expressed online emotions predict the profitability of actual trading behavior. Relative to their baselines, traders who expressed little emotion or traders that expressed high levels of emotion made relatively unprofitable trades. Conversely, traders expressing moderate levels of emotional activation made relatively profitable trades."
